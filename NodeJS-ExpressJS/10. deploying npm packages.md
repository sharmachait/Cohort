for stuff like zod schemas

create account on npmjs.com

>npm login

in the package.json the name should be well defined 
a good rule of thumb is to name like `@username/domain`
also the main property in the pacakge.json should have to correct path to the entry point index.js file like so `"main":"dist/index.js"`
but if we dont publish our typescript files people wont be able to access our types

> npm publish --access=public

this pushes the package to npm
to see the files we published to npm
>npm pack

this will create a zip file in the folder with our package.json or a tar file

but if we dont want to publish some file to npm add it in the .npmignore file
write `src` in it and save. this will then disallow npm to publish the typescript code

if we run publish again it will throw an error because we need to increment the version in the package.json

but doing just this with typescript is not enough because we wont be able to import from it into typescript with `.d.ts` files

to import from .js to .ts we need the type declaration file
to make the tsc compiler compile the type declarations for us 
in the tsconfig.json set 
`"declaration":true`
