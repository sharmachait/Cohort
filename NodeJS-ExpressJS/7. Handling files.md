we need to install a npm package to handle multipart form data in node rest api requests and use it as middleware.

```js
const multer = require('multer');
const uploadMiddleware = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });

app.post('/post', uploadMiddleware.single('file'), (req, res) => {
//here file must match the name of the property in the req.file json
	res.json(req.file);
});
```

the string file must be the key of the FormData object that contains the file that is at the front end the following thing must have happened

```jsx
data.set('file', files[0]);
```

this middleware automatically uploads the file that is being received from the frontend to the specified folder
### serving files
to allow frontend to get files using the file system path [[4. Sending Files]] we need to use the static file middleware as well
```js
app.use('/uploads', express.static(__dirname + '/uploads'));
```
