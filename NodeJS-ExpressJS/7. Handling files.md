we need to install a npm package to handle multipart form data in node rest api requests and use it as middleware.

```js
const multer = require('multer');
const uploadMiddleware = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });

app.post('/post', uploadMiddleware.single('file'), (req, res) => {
//here file must match the name of the property in the req.file json
	res.json(req.file);
});
```

this middleware automatically uploads the file that is being received format from the frontend to the specified folder

we can make default columns for created and update dates like so in mongoDB
```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const { Schema, model } = mongoose;
  
const PostSchema = new Schema({
    title: String,
    summary: String,
    content: String,
    cover: String
}, {
    timestamps: true
});
```

### serving files
to allow frontend to get files using the file system path [[4. Sending Files]] we need to use the static file middleware as well
```js
app.use('/uploads', express.static(__dirname + '/uploads'));
```
