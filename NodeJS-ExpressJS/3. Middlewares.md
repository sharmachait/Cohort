- Auth checks
- input validation

###### implementation
user defined middlewares are simply functions that take 3 parameters, the request object the response object and the next function
```js
function userMiddleware(req,res,next){
	//logic
	if(userValid(req.header.username,req.header.password)) next();
	else res.status(403).send("unauthorized");
};
```
we can then inject this middle ware in all the endpoints we want like so
```js
app.get('/route',userMiddleware,(req,res)=>{res.send("");});
```

- the next function when called in the middleware invokes the callback we gave to the endpoint (req,res)=>{}
- in this way we would need to give the middleware to each and every endpoint

we can pass multiple middleware functions to the endpoints
```js
app.get("/route",userMiddleware,secondMiddleware,(req,res)=>{res.send("");});
```

### actually we can provide multiple callback functions to the endpoints we were defining , and all of the will be called in order , if the previous callback sends a response or calls the next call back explicitly

### and there are three possible parameters for the callbacks, req, res and next

the way to pass data from the middleware to the final callback is by setting it in the req object

##### app.use() for global middlewares
typical example body json parser, request counter 
```js
function myMiddleware(req,res,next){
//logic
next();
};
app.use(express.json());
app.use(myMiddleware);
```

#### another type of middleware is called a global catch
global catches are defined at the end of the routes, we can pass that middleware 4 parameters (err,req,res,next)
if there is a error in any of the routes this middleware can be used to handle that 
it would look something like this
```js
const express=require("express");
const app=express();
app.use(express.json());
app.post("route",(req,res)=>{
	//throw error here
});
app.use((err,req,res,next)=>{
	//handle error here
});
```

#### ways to make a middleware run after the endpoint
1. app.use(middleware);
	1. do this after the route
2. set a response event listener on "finish", in a middleware before the endpoint
```js
const afterApiCallMiddleware = (req, res, next) => { 
	res.on('finish', () => { 
		// Middleware logic to be executed after the API call is finished 
		console.log('Middleware after API call'); 
	}); 
	next(); 
};

app.use(afterApiCallMiddleware);
app.post("/route",(req,res)=>{res.send("");});
app.use((err,req,res,next)=>{
	res.send(err);
});
```

control reaches the middleware with the err object is it is defined after the endpoint, and some error is thrown in that endpoint

we can have multiple error handling middlewares and the control can be passed to next ones with the the next()
