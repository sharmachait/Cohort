- fetch returns a promise and we can use the .then() syntax with it
```js
function getAnimalData(){
	fetch("https://fakerapi.it/api/v1/persons")
	.then(function(response){
		response.json()//convert response to json, returns a promise
		.then(function(data){
			setData(data.data);
			console.log(data.data);
		});
	});
}
```

in async await syntax
```js
async function getData(){
	const res=await fetch("https://fakerapi.it/api/v1/persons");
	const json=await res.json();
	console.log(json.data);
}
```
##### cryptography jargon
1. hashing - one way encryption
2. encryption - can be decrypted, requires a key, a secret
3. JWT - some encryption function that only works for json input, can be decoded by anyone but can be verified using only the password, technically its a digital signature
4. Local storage - 
		==1. localStorage.setItem(key, val);== 
		==2. localStorage.getItem(key);==
5. salt - if two people have the same password their hash will be same too, then if someone knows one password, and they know that both the hashes are the same too, that means their passwords are same too, to counter this we add random gibberish to the password called the salt

## working with JWT
1. external dependency jsonwebtoken
> npm install jsonwebtoken
2. functionalities needed like creating jwt and verifying jwt are provided by this library
```js
const jwt=require("jsonwebtoken");
let token=jwt.sign(json,secret);

let decodedJson=jwt.verify(token,secret);
decodedJson.propertiesClaimed
```

3. if the data received if json we cant simply add it to the inner html of some tag, we first have to strigify it using the JSON library
```js
document.getElementById("userData").innerHTML = JSON.stringify(data);
```

## authentication
we will create a middleware to handle authentication for us after signup and sign in
### cookie
```ts
spp.use(cookieParse());
```
we can respond back with cookie like so
```js
res.status(200).cookie("token", token).json('ok');
```
and it is set in the response header
we can specify the expiration time for a cookie in milliseconds like so
```js
res.status(200).cookie('token',token,{maxAge:60000*60});
```
when a cookie reaches its `Max-Age` or `Expires` attribute value, it is considered expired. An expired cookie will no longer be sent with browser requests and will be deleted

but to be able to this we have to specify this in the cors configuration like so
```js
app.use(cors({ credentials: true, origin: 'http://localhost:5173' }));
```

### signed cookies
to send signed cookies
```js
res.status(200).cookie('token',token,{maxAge:60000,signed:true})
```
we must also register the secret to sign the cookies with
```js
app.use(cookieParser(process.env.COOKIE_SECRET))
```
after signing they are accessed through 
```js
req.signedCookies.token;
```
in the frontend we need to receive the cookie like so
```js
let response = await fetch("http://localhost:3000/login", {
            method: "POST",
            headers: {
                "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
                "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "POST, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE",
                "Content-Type": "application/json"
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({ username, password }),
            credentials: 'include',
        });
```
##### extending the req object for our middleware to inject the cookie in it
```ts
const cookies= res.signedCookies;
const at = cookies.at;
```
if we want to set the cookies in the req object we would need to extend the request interface with that type
```ts
req.aToken = at;
```
create a types folder and create an `index.d.ts` file with the types (so that the types are global for all other files, if we create it at the same file level as index the types are used only for the index.ts file)
```ts 
//types/index.d.ts
declare namespace Express {  
    interface Request {  
        aToken:string;  
    }  
}
```

### sessions
> npm i express-session

```js
import session from "express-session";
import express from "express";
const app=express();
app.use(session({
	secret:process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
	saveUninitialized:false,
	resave:false,
	cookie:{
		maxAge:60000 * 60
	}
}));
```

we can access the session object in a route like so
```js
app.get('/',(req,res)=>{
	console.log(req.session);
	console.log(req.session.id);
});
```

but these sessions are transient and are regenerated for each request, unless we modify them
when we modify sessions the cookies are sent to the client, and will be received, and if the received cookies are valid express wont regenerate them.
just do something as simple as this
```js
req.session.visited=true;
```
after this the session id can be referenced in a different endpoint to know which user it is
but this session store is only in memory
we can get session object using session id like so
```js
req.sessionStore.get(req.session.id,(err,data)=>{
	if(err){
		log(err);
		throw err;
	}
	log(data);
});
```
so like this we can check if the session is valid and hasnt expired
