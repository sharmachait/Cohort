## side effects

any operations that reach outside the functional scope of a react component. 
everything that is not rendering to the frontend is technically a side effect
## hooks
allow us to 'hook into react state and access lifecycle features'
introduced in react 16.8
##### useEffect
1. to run code when something mounts => use effect
2. to run code when something changes => use effect with dependency array
3. to run code when something un-mounts => return from use effect
```jsx 
function Todos(){
	useEffect(()=>{
		return ()=>{
			alert("un mounted");
		};
	},[someState]);
}
```

##### useCallback
