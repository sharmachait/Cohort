## side effects

any operations that reach outside the functional scope of a react component. 
everything that is not rendering to the frontend is technically a side effect
## hooks
allow us to 'hook into react state and access lifecycle features'
introduced in react 16.8

##### useState
![[Pasted image 20240302231302.png]]
this will only log "0" when we click the button the first time, the value changes for the new mount.
this is not the right way to update the state instead use this syntax
```jsx
setCount(prev=>prev+1);
```
##### useEffect
1. to run code when something mounts => use effect
2. to run code when something changes => use effect with dependency array
3. to run code when something un-mounts => return from use effect
```jsx 
function Todos(){
	useEffect(()=>{
		return ()=>{
			alert("un mounted");
		};
	},[someState]);
}
```
3. if we put a non state variable in the useEffect we need to make sure it has referential equality
##### useMemo
to memoize some calculation based on some state
if my component has two states and we have some java script computation going on on one of the states then it is re computed every time the other state updates as well, which is redundant. we only want it to compute when the state it is using updates. in this case we can memoize that calculation for the state variable it depends on

```jsx
function App(){
	const [clicker,setClicker]=useState(0);
	const [input,setInput]=useState(0);
	let count=useMemo(()=>{
		let c=0;
		for(let i=0;i<=input;i++)
			c+=i;
		return c;
	},[input])
	
	return (
		<div>
			<input onChange={(e)=>{setInput(e.target.value)}}/>
			
			<button onClick={(e)=>{setClicker(clicker+1)}}>clicker</button>
		</div>
	);
}
```

never put an array in the dependency array of a useEffect, use useMemo on it first
##### useCallback
used to memoize functions, to optimize cases where child components rely on referential equality to prevent unnecessary renders, useCallback gives us a function with referential equality that we can call later, maybe in a useMemo
###### referential equality
==checking equality on address==
useMemo memoizes the output of a function not the function itself, useCallback memoizes the function
we can do simple calculation we did in the above useMemo example in a useEffect as well but a number is primitive and has referential equality, so it wont be calculated again and again when a we click on the clicker, but had the dependency  been an object or an array or a function it would have been run again and again because they get new address every render

if we want to memoize for a function then we use useCallback on the function and then stick it into the useMemo

```jsx
function App(){
	const [clicker,setClicker]=useState(0);
	const [input,setInput]=useState(0);
	
	let counterCallback=useCallback((countTill)=>{
		let c=0;
		for(let i=0;i<=countTill;i++)
			c+=i;
		return c;
	},[]);
	
	let count=useMemo(()=>{
		return counterCallback(input);
	},[input, counter])
	
	return (
		<div>
			<input onChange={(e)=>{setInput(e.target.value)}}/>
			
			<button onClick={(e)=>{setClicker(clicker+1)}}>clicker</button>
		</div>
	);
}
```

==useCallback is useMemo but for functions==

##### useRef
used to get access to dom elements, to maybe overwrite innerhtml or to put element in focus

```jsx
function App(){
	const divRef=useRef();
	useEffect(()=>{
		divRef.current.innerHTML='10';
	},[]);
	const value=20;
	return (
		<div ref={divRef}>{value}</div>
	);
}
```

other use case for useRef is to maintain a variable across renders
