## side effects

any operations that reach outside the functional scope of a react component. 
everything that is not rendering to the frontend is technically a side effect
## hooks
allow us to 'hook into react state and access lifecycle features'
introduced in react 16.8
##### useEffect
1. to run code when something mounts => use effect
2. to run code when something changes => use effect with dependency array
3. to run code when something un-mounts => return from use effect
```jsx 
function Todos(){
	useEffect(()=>{
		return ()=>{
			alert("un mounted");
		};
	},[someState]);
}
```

##### useCallback



##### useMemo
to memoize some calculation based on some state
if my component has two states and we have some java script computation going on one of the states then it is re computed everytime the other state updates as well, which is redundant. we only want it to compute when the state it is using updates. in this case we can memoize that calculation for the state variable it depends on

```jsx
function App(){
	const [clicker,setClicker]=useState(0);
	const [input,setInput]=useState(0);
	let count=useMemo(()=>{
		let c=0;
		for(let i=0;i<=input;i++){
			c+=i;
		}
		return c;
	},[input])
	
	return (
		<div>
			<input onChange={(e)=>{setInput(e.target.value)}}/>
			
			<button onClick={(e)=>{setClicker(clicker+1)}}>clicker</button>
		</div>
	);
}
```
