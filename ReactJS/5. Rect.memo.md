1. useState you should know
2. useEffect you should know

react can not return multiple children tags, why not?
1. makes its easier to reconcile, to figure out what DOM updates must happen

code like this would cause all the header tags to be re-rendered while we only want the first one to be

a re-render happens when
1. a state variable that is being used inside a component changes
2. a parent component re-render triggers the re-rendering of all children components
in our case the second thing is happening

to fix this we can do 2 things 
1. push the state down to the header component, the one it needs to re-render with when updated like so
![[Pasted image 20240217140819.png]]
2. a better solution is to use react Memo
		memo lets you skip re-rendering a component when its props are unchanged

how to use react.memo convert the normal component to anonymous and shove it into React.memo
```jsx
function Header({title}){
	return (
		<div>{title}</div>
	);
}
```

to

```jsx
const Header = React.memo(
	function Header({title}){
		return (
			<div>{title}</div>
		);
	}
)
```

and now if i call multiple of them in the app.jsx and the parent component re-renders they wont be re-rendered unless they are using a state that updates
for example
```jsx
function App(){
	const [title,setTitle]=useState("not updated");
	function updateTitle(){
		setTitle("updated" + Math.random());
	}
	return (
		<div>
			<button onClick={updateTitle}> click to update </button>
			<Header title={title}></Header>
			<Header title="some title"></Header>
		</div>
	)
}

const Header=React.memo(function Header({title}){
	return <div>
		{title}
	</div>
});
```

only the first Header is re-rendered when we click because all the headers are memoized and we only need to recompute the first header because it is using a state that was updated
