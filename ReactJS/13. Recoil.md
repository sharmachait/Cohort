dddddddthe problem with context? even the components not using the context to get some state are re-rendered if the context is updated because they are wrapped in it?

Recoil stores state in something called an Atom
Atoms can be defined outside the components
Atoms can be teleported to any component and only those components would be updated

What's an Atom? smallest unit of state

> npm install recoil

### concepts to know
###### atom
- usually created in a file in the **projectRoot/store/atoms/** folder
- name the file according to the state like "count.jsx"
```jsx
import {atom} from "recoil";

const countAtom=atom({
	key:"countAtom",
	default:0
});
```
here key is just unique identifier for an atom
atom states are valid states and can be used inside useEffects
###### useRecoilState
equivalent to useState(), gives both the getter and the setter of the state variable
```jsx
const [getCount,setCount] =useRecoilState(countAtom);
```
###### useRecoilValue
this gives us only the getter of the state variable. this is slightly performant to use
```jsx
const getCount =useRecoilValue(countAtom);
```
###### useSetRecoilState
gives only the setter of the state variable. this is slightly performant to use
```jsx
const setCount =useSetRecoilState(countAtom);
```
###### RecoilRoot
just like the context provider needs to wrap everything so does the RecoilRoot
```jsx
function App(){
	return (
		<RecoilRoot>
			<Count/>
		</RecoilRoot>
	);
}
```
###### Selectors
selector is a state derived from another state, its basically the output of passing the state into a pure function
so if we have a count state as atom and we pass it into a pure function that tells if it is even or not, we can use the out put of that function as part of state as well, if we use selectors

just like useMemo, when we want some value to be dependent on some other state we use the useMemo on it so it isn't calculated every time, only when the state change, just like that we should use the selector for performance benefits

we can make our selector functions in a file in the **/projectRoot/store/selectors** directory

```jsx 
import {selector} from "recoil";
import {countAtom} from "store/atoms"

export const evenSelector=selector({
	key: "evenSelector",
	get: ({get})=>{
		const count=get(countAtom);
		return count%2==0;
	}
});
```
this example of selector depends only on the countAtom, but they can depend on multiple Atoms
selectors can depend on other selectors too

using a selector
```jsx
const isEven = useRecoilValue(evenSelector);
```
this returns what ever was returned in the selector
###### asynchronous data queries with recoil
from some API endpoint
naive way
```jsx
const [networkCount, setNetworkCount] = seRecoilState(notifications)
useEffect(() => {
	axios.get("https://sum-server.100xdevs.com/notifications")
	.then(res => {
		setNetworkCount(res.data)
	});
}, []);
```
in the atom we want to somehow hit the backend and get the default data before any component uses it
why? because the components would otherwise first render the default value and then over write it with the value they get from the useEffect , but the end user would be able to see the default data

the way to solve it is using selectors because their get property can be an asynchronous function and returning a promise instead of the value itself

in the atom make default value a selector that returns a 
```jsx
const userInfoState=atom({
	key:"useInfoState",
	default: selector({
		key: "asyncUserState".
		get: async ()=>{
			let res await axios.get('url');
			return res.data;
		}
	})
});
```
==the component using this atom is only rendered when the promise is fulfilled and the data is returned till then the component is not rendered==
###### atomFamily
use when we want more than one component to have a shared atom, and the atom should have dynamic values depending on the component.
one solution is to have a new atom per component
==or use Atom family==
rather than making the component subscribe to the atom make them subscribe to the atom family, in case of a todo app, the family can be the Todos atom family, to store multiple todos
we give the atom family an id we need the values for and it provides us a new atom for that id
![[Pasted image 20240314001419.png|400]]
we can get the values from the atom family via the useRecoilValue hook on the family function calling it with an id
```jsx
function App(){
	return <RecoilRoot>
		<Todo id={i}/>
	</RecoilRoot>
}
function Todo({id}){
	const todoForId=useRecoilValue(todoAtomFamily(id));
	return <>
		{todoForid.title}
	</>
}
```
how are atom families defined?
```jsx
export const todosAtomFamily=atomFamily({
	key:"todosAtomFamily",
	default: (id)=>{
		return todos.find(todo=>todo.id===id);//or some other logic
	}
});
```
if we call the atom family function multiple times with the same value, the logic is not run twice the value is cached
```jsx
todosAtomFamily(1);//runs and caches the value
todosAtomFamily(1);//cached value is returned
```
we can also use useRecoilState hook on the atom family
```jsx
const [todo, setTodo] = useRecoilState(todosAtomFamily(id));
```
think of atom family like the atom factory and the atom for some particular is shared among all the components that called an atom with the same id
use atom family when we want atoms to be dynamic in nature

all this is fine when the data is static and has been loaded into a todos object
but what if we want to fetch data from the backend?
that's where selector families come into the picture
###### selectorFamily
because selectors are allowed to have async functions in them we can use a selector family to create a selector for me, poll the backend asynchronously and return the data for some input
a selector family is just a selector factory which returns the same reference for a selector every time given some input (same as before)
we can use
like we had a selector as the default value of the atom
we can have a selector family as the default value of the atomfamily
and we can use that atom family in the useRecoilState hook
there for  this code doesnt change
```jsx 
function App(){
	return <RecoilRoot>
		<Todo id={i}/>
	</RecoilRoot>
}
function Todo({id}){
	const todoForId=useRecoilValue(todoAtomFamily(id));
	return <>
		{todoForid.title}
	</>
}
```
only the implementation of the todo atom family changes
```jsx
export const todoAtomFamily = atomFamily({
	key: 'todoAtomFamily',
	default: selectorFamily({
		key: 'todoSelectorFamily',
		get: (id) => {
			return async ({get})=>{
				const res=await axios.get(url+id);
				return res.data;
			};
		}
	})
});
```
use family when we want the atom to have a default value that is coming from the backend

but what if the backend request takes a lot of time? we want our application to show some kind of a loader
we can use the suspense api or the error boundary api
or use the useRecoilStateLoadable hook instead of the useRecoilState hook
###### useRecoilStateLoadable
this hook returns a getter object {contents, state} and a setter
this state tells us whether or not the the backend api call has resolved
when not resolved the state is set to "loading" and when resolved changes to "has value"
and all the content that would have been returned after the api call can be accessed through the contents property of the getter
```jsx
const [todo,setTodo]=useRecoildStateLoadable(todosAtomFamily(1));
if(todo.state==='hasValue')
	return <>{todo.contents.title}</>
```
the state also another property for error handling
```jsx
todo.state === 'hasError'
```
###### useRecoilValueLoadable
