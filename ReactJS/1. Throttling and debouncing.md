button attributes, onClich, onChange, onInput
### debouncing
- the problem with onInput attribute is that  it will call the backend for each keystroke
- what we want realistically is that if we type a lot of characters together, or give a lot of inputs together, we want to send a backend request at the end of the typing stream of input stream, doing this is called debouncing.
- example is search bar suggestions
- a simple example could be like if the user hasnt given any input in 100ms then we can start processing the input
- can be solved by creating a wrapper function over  the functions that is being used to call the backend
- the wrapper function's job is to call the original function only if the wrapper function hasnt been called in 100ms
- to do this we need to set clocks and clear clocks, can be done with setTimeout and clearTimeout
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<script>
    let timeout = 0;
    function debouncedSum() {
        clearTimeout(timeout);
        timeout = setTimeout(() => { sum(); }, 2000);
    }
  
    function sum() {
        let one = document.getElementById("one").value;
        let two = document.getElementById("two").value;
        let sum = parseInt(one) + parseInt(two);
        document.getElementById("finalSum").innerText = sum;
    }
</script>
  
<body>
    <input onInput="debouncedSum()" type="text" id="one" placeholder="first"></input><br />
    <input type="text" id="two" onInput="debouncedSum()" placeholder="second" /><br />
    <div id="finalSum"></div>
</body>
  
</html>
```
### throttling and rate limiting 
happens at the backend
rate limiting - if same endpoint requested from the same ip address, multiple times within say 100ms ignore all the calls except the last one
throttling - backend gets a lot of requests, it does kind of an exponential backoff in responding to it,
responds to the first request in 1 second, to the second in 2 to the third in 5 to the fourth in 10 and so on
