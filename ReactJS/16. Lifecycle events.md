functions that define code that will be triggered when some event happens

when mounting or unmounting

in class components we have ```
```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component{
	componentDidMount(){}
	componentWillUnmount(){}
}
```

in functional components we have the equivalent useEffect hook and the cleanup function it returns

```jsx
function MyComponent(){
	useEffect(()=>{ 
		
		return ()=>{};//cleanup function
	},[]);// the clean up function is run for the previous unmount whne a new mount happens
}
```

==hooks give access to lifecycle events to functional components==
