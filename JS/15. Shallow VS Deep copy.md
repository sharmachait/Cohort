### Mutable vs Immutable
```js 
let c="dave";
c[0]="w";//doesnt work
console.log(c);//dave
```
strings are immutable
defining an array with const doesnt make it immutable

#### pure functions
dont mutate the input data

### shallow copies
made via 
1. spread operator
```js
const z=[...x,10];
```
2. Object.assign
```js
const h=Object.assign([],z);
```
both share different references in memory
```js
h===z //false
```

shallow copies like these work only when the array we are making copy of has only primitives

if we have nested arrays OR array with other By-ref objects then the by ref objects are still copied by reference, that is the nested array has the same reference in the original and the copy

Array.from and Array.splice also create shallow copies

same kind of logic applies to Object.freeze(), it only freezes an object to the first (shallow) level

```js
const nested={
	a:1,
	nest:{
		b:2
	}
};

Object.freeze(nested);
// we can still mutate nested.nest.b=3;
```

### Deep Copy

libraries like ==lodash==

vanilla JS soln odesnt work with dates and other datatypes
```js
const newObj=JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));
```
