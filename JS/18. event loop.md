## how is code executed
the v8 engine has heap and stack 
all the declared variables go to the heap
all the functions are pushed on the stack
- In web browsers, the global object is `window`.
- In Node.js, the global object is `global`.
global scope is scope associated with the global object.

but whenever we execute an async method its subject to `libuv` which will try to execute it using the OS if possible, or using its own built in mechanisms

1. every program begins with the global scope being pushed on to the stack

2. the first log is loaded on to the stack, popped off and executed
3. the second function is an asynchronous function that is loaded on to the stack, but its functionality and the callback are delegated to libuv so for all intent and purposes it is loaded off the stack and given to `libuv`

4. in the background libuv starts to read the file contents on a separate thread if possible by the runtime
5. immediately then the third log statement is loaded on to the stack, popped off and executed

6. whenever the file read task is completed the callback that was off loaded to libuv will be re mounted on to the stack, popped off and executed

7. at the end even the global scope is popped off the stack
8. but at what point is the associated callback executed?
9. what if two async tasks finish together? which callback will be executed first, decided by the event loop of libuv

## event loop
![[Pasted image 20240517103643.png]]
the event loop is comprised of 6 queues
1. macro task queues
	1. timer queue - setTimeout, setInterval
	2. I/O queue - read file write file
	3. check queue - for primarily only the setImmediate function
	4. close queue -  for the closing callback events of async tasks
2. ==micro task queues== - there are two queues in it
	1. next tick queue - only for callbacks associated with process.nextTick() function
	2. ==promise queue== - for all promises

all the macro task queues are part of libuv
all these queues define the order of execution of functions
#### priority order of the queues
all user written synchronous code takes priority over async code that the runtime would like to eventually execute

only when the call stack is empty does the event loop get any priority
after every macro task queue we go back to check the micro task queue which is why its called the event loop
1. micro task queue
	1. next tick
	2. promise
2. Timer queue
3. after the timer queue we check the micro task queue again
4.  IO queue
5. after the IO queue go back to check the micro task queue again
6. check queue
7. after the check queue go back to check the micro task queue again
8. close queue
9. after the close queue go back to check the micro task queue again

if there are still more callbacks the loop is kept alive and one more pass is made in the same order

#### microtask queues
we can add a callback in the next tick queue with 
```js
process.nextTick(()=>{
	console.log("hello from the next tick queue");
});
```
we add a function in the promise queue when ever we resolve a promise
```js
Promise.resolve().then(()=>{
	console.log("hello from the promise queue");
});
```
## example
![[Pasted image 20240531123544.png]]
promise resolve() goes to the call stack is popped off
then() goes to the stack
	callback goes to the microtask queue
	then() is popped off
setTimeout goes to the call stack
	callback is put in the macro task queue after 10 miliseconds
	setTimeout is popped off
queueMicrotask goes to the call stack
	call back goes to the micro task queue
	queueMicrotask is popped off
console.log(5) goes to the call stack 5 is printed and log is popped of
microtask queue is checked, we find the call back from then(), it goes to the call stack its executed and 1 is printed and the call back is popped off
next we have the queueMicrotask callback which goes to the call stack
	console.log(3) goes to the call stack
		3 is printed
		log is popped off
	next queueMicrotask goes to the call stack
		call back goes to microtask queue
	queueMicrotask is popped off
next we have another call back from queueMicrotask in the queue
	goes to the call stack, its executed log(4) goes to the call stack 4 is printed and both are popped off
call stack is empty micro task queue is empty 
10ms have passed
macro task queue is checked we find call back, goes to the call stack
log(2) goes to the call stack executed and both are popped off

one more pass of the event loop happens
everything is empty we can exit
