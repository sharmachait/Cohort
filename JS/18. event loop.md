## how is code executed
the v8 engine has heap and stack 
all the declared variables go to the heap
all the functions are pushed on the stack

but whenever we execute an async method its subject to `libuv` which will try to execute it using the OS if possible, or using its own built in mechanisms

1. every program begins with the global scope being pushed on to the stack

2. the first log is loaded on to the stack, popped off and executed
3. the second function is an asynchronous function that is loaded on to the stack, but its functionality and the callback are delegated to libuv so for all intent and purposes it is loaded off the stack and given to `libuv`

4. in the background libuv starts to read the file contents on a separate thread if possible by the runtime
5. immediately then the third log statement is loaded on to the stack, popped off and executed

6. whenever the file read task is completed the callback that was off loaded to libuv will be re mounted on to the stack, popped off and executed

7. at the end even the global scope is popped off the stack
8. but at what point is the associated callback executes?
9. what if two asyn tasks finish together? which callback will be executed first, decided by the event loop of libuv

## event loop
![[Pasted image 20240517103643.png]]
the event loop is comprised of 6 queues
1. macro task queues
	1. timer queue - setTimeout, setInterval
	2. I/O queue - read file write file
	3. check queue - for primarily only the setImmediate function
	4. close queue -  for the closing callback events of async tasks
2. micro task queues - there are two queues in it
	1. next tick queue - only for callbacks associated with process.nextTick() function
	2. promise queue - for all promises

all the macro task queues are part of libuv
all these queues define the order of execution of functions
