setTimeout is asynchronus 
we import modules in java script like so 
const fs=require("fs")

when the async task is completed it goes into the call back queue, and is processed when the main thread gets free

async evolves from [[3. Promises]]

promises are await-able

when i do 
```js
let result=await promise_variable;
```
result gets what ever the promise resolves to when we do .then for example
we can use await keyword only in an async function

```js
function returns_promise_string(){
	return new Promise(function(resolve){
		setTimeout(function(){
			resolve('hi there')
		},5000);
	})
}

function returns_promise_object(){
	return new Promise(function(resolve){
		setTimeout(function(){
			resolve({"prop1":"val1","prop2":"val2"});
		},5000);
	})
}

async function main(){
	let res=await returns_promise_string();
	let obj=await returns_promise_object();
	console.log(res);
	console.log(obj);
}
main();
```

await is thread blocking if instead of await we used the .then syntax the thread will continue and the call back function will be processed when the thread is idle

but here as soon as we do await the thread starts waiting for the promise to resolve
