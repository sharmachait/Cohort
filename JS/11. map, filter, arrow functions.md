```js
const sum=(a,b)=>{return a+b;};
```
there actually is a difference between arrow functions and normal functions, specifically the way "this is binded in both"

- if i want to do something to every element of an array i can wrap it in a function that takes the element as parameter, call .map(callback) on the array
```js
let arr=[1,2,3,4,5];
let newarr=arr.map(tranformation);
```
- map is not in-place, it returns the new array that is transformed

- if we want to do some deduction on the array, we want some conditions to be applied to all the elements, and return only the elements that satisfy that condition we can use the filter function
```js
let arr=[1,2,3,4,5,6];
let newarr=arr.filter((i)=>{return i%2==0;})
```
