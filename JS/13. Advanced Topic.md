# hoisting
1. const is not hoisted
2. functions are hoisted as well
3. unless the function is an arrow function and is assigned to a variable
4. arrow function would not be hoisted, even if defined with let
```js
console.log(constfunc());
const constfunc=()=>{return "hi";};
```
5. the above code throws an error because we are referencing a function that hasn't been defined yet in the JS control flow
6. but all the functions defined with the function keyword will be hoisted
7. var keyword variables/functions are always hoisted
8. but with var only the declaration is hoisted up not the initialization so we will get undefined
9. the following code will print undefined
```js
console.log(a);
var a=2;
```
# closures
```js
let globalx = 1;
function parent() {
    let scopedx = 2;
    console.log("scoped x from parent " + scopedx);
    console.log("global x from parent " + globalx);
    console.log();
    function child() {
        console.log("scoped x from child " + scopedx++);
        console.log("global x from child " + globalx++);
        console.log();
    }
    child();
    return child;
}
  
let ref = parent();
ref();
ref();
ref();
```

```output
scoped x from parent 2
global x from parent 1

scoped x from child 2
global x from child 1

scoped x from child 3
global x from child 2

scoped x from child 4
global x from child 3

scoped x from child 5
global x from child 4
```

closure in javascript means what all variables will a function have access to, in the above example, the child function has access to both scoped variable in the parent function and the global variables

closure for a function is calculated at the point it is defined, it will have access to those variables even after its parent function has ended

if we return a reference to the child function from the parent function we can access the variables (private by all means) via the child functions
 other way to do this would be to use arrow functions in the parent function and set them to globally declared variables
 
```js
let globalx = 1;
let getter;
function parent() {
    let scopedx = 2;
    console.log("scoped x from parent " + scopedx);
    console.log("global x from parent " + globalx);
    console.log();
    getter = () => {
        console.log("scoped x from child " + scopedx++);
        console.log("global x from child " + globalx++);
        console.log();
    }
    getter();
}
parent();//it is required to call the parent function once
getter();
getter()
```

the children functions can be getters and setters over the scoped variables of the parent functions

most common use case is in the fetch() .thens()

```js
functions fetcher(url){
	fetch(url).then(()=>{
							log(url);
						});
}
```

# currying
transforming a function from taking multiple arguments to nested functions taking single arguments
```js
function fn(a,b,c){return a+b+c;}/=>
function curry(a){
	return function fnb(b){
		return function fnc(c){
			return fn(a,b,c);
		};
	}; 
}
curry(2)(3)(4);//9
```
it works because of closures

# implicit this binding
```js
let walterWhite={
	name:"heisenberg",
	sayMyName:()=>{
		console.log(`${this.name}? you are god damn right`);
	}
};
```

# explicit this binding
```js
let walterWhite={
	name:"heisenberg"
};
function sayMyName(){
	console.log(`${this.name}? you are god damn right`);
}
sayMyName.call(walterWhite);
```

# new binding
this is bound to an empty object
these functions are called constructor functions
```js
function Person(name){
	//this = {}
	this.name=name;
	//return this;
}
const p1=new Person('Vishwas');
const p2=new Person('batman');
```

# default binding 
happens when no other binding can happen

```js
function sayMyName(){
	console.log(`${this.name}? you are god damn right`);
}
sayMyName();
```
if we call this function with no object this defaults to the global object that is the NVM object 
we can access the global object with
```js
globalThis.name='batman';
```

when multiple rules can be applied, there is an order of priority
1. new binding
2. explicit binding
3. implicit binding
4. default binding

# prototype

```js
function Person(fname,lname){
	this.first=fname;
	this.last=lname;
}
```
we can make instances of the function with
```js
cosnt chaitanya=new Person("chaitanya","sharma");
cosnt batman=new Person("bat","man");
```
we can attach properties to these objects;
```js
batman.getName=()=>{return this.first+" "+this.last;}
```
but this function is only part of batman and not part of chaitanya
we could have attached it to the prototype of function Person so that all it instances would have that function
```js
Person.prototype.getName=()=>{return this.first+" "+this.last;}
```

## inheritance via prototypes prototypal inheritance
1. make a function person
2. make a function superhero
3. assign to the prototype a copy of the prototype of person
4. this copy will be looked at when there is failed lookup of properties in the child function
```js
function Person(fname,lname){
	this.first=fname;
	this.last=lname;
}

Person.prototype.getName=()=>{return this.first+" "+this.last;}

function SuperHero(fname,lname){
	Person.call(this,fname,lname);
	this.isSuperHero=true;
}

// using Object.create to delegate to the prototype of Person for failed look ups
SuperHero.prototype=Object.create(Person.prototype);
//this makes the prototype of super hero chain to the prototype of Person

SuperHero.prototype.fightCrime = ()=>{console.log("fighing crime")};


const batman=new SuperHero("Chaitanya","Sharma");

//we can now do 
batman.getName();
```
but right now JS thinks superhero is created from the Person constructor we need to clean that up with
```js
SuperHero.prototype.constructor = SuperHero
```
now super hero can be used correctly
