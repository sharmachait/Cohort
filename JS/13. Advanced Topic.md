# closures
```js
let globalx = 1;
function parent() {
    let scopedx = 2;
    console.log("scoped x from parent " + scopedx);
    console.log("global x from parent " + globalx);
    console.log();
    function child() {
        console.log("scoped x from child " + scopedx++);
        console.log("global x from child " + globalx++);
        console.log();
    }
    child();
    return child;
}
  
let ref = parent();
ref();
ref();
ref();
```

```output
scoped x from parent 2
global x from parent 1

scoped x from child 2
global x from child 1

scoped x from child 3
global x from child 2

scoped x from child 4
global x from child 3

scoped x from child 5
global x from child 4
```

closure in javascript means what all variables will a function have access to, in the above example, the child function has access to both scoped variable in the parent function and the global variables

closure for a function is calculated at the point it is defined, it will have access to those variables even after its parent function has ended

if we return a reference to the child function from the parent function we can access the variables (private by all means) via the child functions
 other way to do this would be to use arrow functions in the parent function and set them to globally declared variables
 
```js
let globalx = 1;
let getter;
function parent() {
    let scopedx = 2;
    console.log("scoped x from parent " + scopedx);
    console.log("global x from parent " + globalx);
    console.log();
    getter = () => {
        console.log("scoped x from child " + scopedx++);
        console.log("global x from child " + globalx++);
        console.log();
    }
    getter();
}
parent();//it is required to call the parent function once
getter();
getter()
```

the children functions can be getters and setters over the scoped variables of the parent functions

most common use case is in the fetch() .thens()

```js
functions fetcher(url){
	fetch(url).then(()=>{
							log(url);
						});
}
```

# currying
transforming a function from taking multiple arguments to nested functions taking single arguments
```js
function fn(a,b,c){return a+b+c;}/=>
function curry(a){
	return function fnb(b){
		return function fnc(c){
			return fn(a,b,c);
		};
	}; 
}
curry(2)(3)(4);//9
```
it works because of closures
