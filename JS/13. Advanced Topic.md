# hoisting
1. const is not hoisted
2. functions are hoisted as well
3. unless the function is an arrow function and is assigned to a variable
4. arrow function would not be hoisted, even if defined with let
```js
console.log(constfunc());
const constfunc=()=>{return "hi";};
```
5. the above code throws an error because we are referencing a function that hasn't been defined yet in the JS control flow
6. but all the functions defined with the function keyword will be hoisted
7. var keyword variables/functions are always hoisted
8. but with var only the declaration is hoisted up not the initialization so we will get undefined
9. the following code will print undefined
```js
console.log(a);
var a=2;
```
# closures
```js
let globalx = 1;
function parent() {
    let scopedx = 2;
    console.log("scoped x from parent " + scopedx);
    console.log("global x from parent " + globalx);
    console.log();
    function child() {
        console.log("scoped x from child " + scopedx++);
        console.log("global x from child " + globalx++);
        console.log();
    }
    child();
    return child;
}
  
let ref = parent();
ref();
ref();
ref();
```

```output
scoped x from parent 2
global x from parent 1

scoped x from child 2
global x from child 1

scoped x from child 3
global x from child 2

scoped x from child 4
global x from child 3

scoped x from child 5
global x from child 4
```

closure in javascript means what all variables will a function have access to, in the above example, the child function has access to both scoped variable in the parent function and the global variables

closure for a function is calculated at the point it is defined, it will have access to those variables even after its parent function has ended

if we return a reference to the child function from the parent function we can access the variables (private by all means) via the child functions
 other way to do this would be to use arrow functions in the parent function and set them to globally declared variables
 
```js
let globalx = 1;
let getter;
function parent() {
    let scopedx = 2;
    console.log("scoped x from parent " + scopedx);
    console.log("global x from parent " + globalx);
    console.log();
    getter = () => {
        console.log("scoped x from child " + scopedx++);
        console.log("global x from child " + globalx++);
        console.log();
    }
    getter();
}
parent();//it is required to call the parent function once
getter();
getter()
```

the children functions can be getters and setters over the scoped variables of the parent functions

most common use case is in the fetch() .thens()

```js
functions fetcher(url){
	fetch(url).then(()=>{
							log(url);
						});
}
```

# currying
transforming a function from taking multiple arguments to nested functions taking single arguments
```js
function fn(a,b,c){return a+b+c;}/=>
function curry(a){
	return function fnb(b){
		return function fnc(c){
			return fn(a,b,c);
		};
	}; 
}
curry(2)(3)(4);//9
```
it works because of closures

# implicit this binding
```js
let walterWhite={
	name:"heisenberg",
	sayMyName:()=>{
		console.log(`${this.name}? you are god damn right`);
	}
};
```

# explicit this binding
```js
let walterWhite={
	name:"heisenberg"
};
function sayMyName(){
	console.log(`${this.name}? you are god damn right`);
}
sayMyName.call(walterWhite);
```

# new binding
this is bound to an empty object
these functions are called constructor functions
```js
function Person(name){
	//this = {}
	this.name=name;
	//return this;
}
const p1=new Person('Vishwas');
const p2=new Person('batman');
```

# default binding 
happens when no other binding can happen

```js
function sayMyName(){
	console.log(`${this.name}? you are god damn right`);
}
sayMyName();
```
if we call this function with no object this defaults to the global object that is the NVM object 
we can access the global object with
```js
globalThis.name='batman';
```

when multiple rules can be applied, there is an order of priority
1. new binding
2. explicit binding
3. implicit binding
4. default binding

# a function that is used with the new keyword is called the constructor function
# prototype

```js
function Person(fname,lname){
	this.first=fname;
	this.last=lname;
}
```
we can make instances of the function with
```js
const chaitanya=new Person("chaitanya","sharma");
const batman=new Person("bat","man");
```
we can attach properties to these objects;
```js
batman.getName=()=>{return this.first+" "+this.last;}
```
### here anonymous functions are not allowed
```js
batman.getName=function (){return this.first+" "+this.last;}
```
because we cant have this in anonymous functions

but this function is only part of batman and not part of chaitanya
we could have attached it to the prototype of function Person so that all it instances would have that function
```js
Person.prototype.getName=function (){return this.first+" "+this.last;}
```

## inheritance via prototypes prototypal inheritance

```js
function Person(f,l){
    this.firstname=f;
    this.last=l;
}
Person.prototype.getName=function(){
    return this.firstname+" "+last;
}

function SuperHero(){
    this.isHero=true;
}
SuperHero.prototype.fight=function(){
	console.log('crime');
}

const batman=new SuperHero();
batman.fight();//crime
```

but this instance of the superhero function doesnt have the firstname and the last properties
to inherit the firstname and the last property of the Person function do the following
1. make the superhero function accept all the properties of the person function
2. pass the this keyword to Person inside the superhero function calling it via ".call"
3. because we want the person function to set firstname and last property to the This reference of the super hero function
```js
function Person(f,l){
    this.firstname=f;
    this.last=l;
}
Person.prototype.getName=function(){
    return this.firstname+" "+this.last;
}
function SuperHero(f,l){
	//this => refers to the superhero instance
	Person.call(this,f,l);
	//we want person to set f and l for the superhero instance
    this.isHero=true;
}
SuperHero.prototype.fight=function(){
	console.log('crime');
}
const batman=new SuperHero("chaitanya","Sharma");
batman.last;//sharma
batman.fight();//crime
batman.isHero;//true
```

as we can see we can access the properties of the Person function through superhero, the properties of superhero function and the properties of the prototype of the superhero function

but this still is not inheriting the properties from the prototype of Person into the prototype of superhero
to inherit properties from the person prototype do the following
```js
SuperHero.prototype=Object.create(Person.prototype);
//this will override all the things we added to the Superhero prototype
```

and now if we try to access any properties that are not part of SuperHero prototype JS will try to find it in the PersonPrototype
```js
const batman=new SuperHero("chaitanya","Sharma");
batman.getName();//chaitanya Sharma
```

but right now JS thinks superhero is created from the Person constructor we need to clean that up with
```js
SuperHero.prototype.constructor = SuperHero
```
now super hero can be used correctly

so we have three things we need to do, inherit the properties, inherit the prototype and over write the constructor for the superhero in its prototype
