module term is used to contrast with script files that run with global scope
when typescript detect that a file is a commonJS or EcmaScript module it starts by assuming file will have its own scope.
in typescript ambient modules allow us to use libraries written in javascript
any function not exported becomes (is assumed by the typescript compiler) to be a part of the ambient module
