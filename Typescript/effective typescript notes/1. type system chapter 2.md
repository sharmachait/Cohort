## components of typescript
1. tsc, the compiler
2. tsserver, the LSP

## Types are sets of values
- number is the set of all possible numbers
- never is the empty set

## structural compatibility vs excess type checking
### structural compatibility
Structural compatibility states that types can have other properties too, which can even be functions,
like a function that expects a 2D vector can also be called with a 3D vector,
it can lead to logical errors, be wary when calling functions

```ts
interface Dvector {
  x: number, 
  y: number
}

function llength(v:Dvector){
  return Math.sqrt(v.x*v.x + v.y*v.y);
}

interface dDvector {
  x: number,
  y: number,
  z: number
}

let a:dDvector = {
  x : 1,
  y : 2,
  z : 3
}
llength(a) // ok doesnt trigger excessive type checking
llength({  
  x : 1,
  y : 2,
  z : 3});
//~~ z may not exist in the type dDvector causes excessive type checking 
```
==we can disallow it preemptively by setting the strict config option==
we can call a function with a super-set of the expected parameter types
### Excess property checking
when we assign an object to a a variable with the declared type, typescript makes sure it has the properties of that type and no other

```ts
interface room {
  numDoors:number,
  width:number
}

let r:room={
  numDoors:1,
  width:2,
  height: 3
//~~~~~~~ Object literal may only specify known properties and height does not exist in type 'Room'
}
```

shouldnt we not have this error? given structural compatibility?
if we introduce an intermediary variable typescript will let us assign to r:room, why ? because it is structurally compatible but why doesnt it allow us to assign to the variable of the incompatible type directly

```ts
interface room {
  numDoors:number,
  width:number
};

let obj={
  numDoors:1,
  width:2,
  height: 3
};

let r:room=obj; //ok no error
```
why? because the type of obj is inferred as {numDoors: number,width: number,height: number}
==the values for the type room are a subset of this type as this type allows number height while room would allow any type of height and this type of assignment doesnt cause excessive type checking like assignment while declaration causes==
assignment at the time of declaration of object will cause excessive type checking and is different from regular assignability checks
excess type checking disallows unknown properties on object literals when theyâ€™re used in a context with a declared type, and hence is called freshness.
==the context in this case could be assignment to a variable with a type, a function argument, or the return value==
this is why using an intermediate variable without type definition make the error go away
excess type checking is over written when we assert type

we can also by pass excessive type checking, by explicitly allowing index signatures but we should not
```ts
interface Options {
  title: string;
  darkMode?: boolean;
}

const o: Options = { darkmode: true, title: 'Ski Free' };
                  // ~~~~~~~~ 'darkmode' does not exist in type 'Options'..
const intermediate = { darkmode: true, title: 'Ski Free' };
const oo: Options = intermediate;  // OK

interface Options2 {
  title: string;
  darkMode?: boolean;
  [otherOptions:string]:unknown
}

const o2: Options2 = { darkmode: true, title: 'Ski Free' }; //ok
```

as similar excessive type checking happens for weekly typed types
```ts
interface some {
	a?: boolean,
	b?:number,
	c?:string
}
function print(a:some){
	console.log(a);
}
const o={aa:false};
print(o);
//   ~~~ Type some has no properties in common with the object o
```
for weekly typed types, that is types where all properties are nullable, typescript throws in another check to see if the structure of the object has atleast one property in common with the type
this is not strictly structural but helps find errors
but unlike excessive type checking this kind of check happens for all assignment operations, an intermediate variable doesnt bypass it
