common type transformations
most important
###### Promise utility type
to tell if a variable can be awaited 
```ts
type apiNumbers=Promise<number>;
type Numbers=Awaited<apiNumbers>;
```
###### Awaited utility type
to tell if a function is a promise has been awaited

1. partial
	a partial is a subtype to a type / interface, allows to declare some of the props of the OG type but not anything thats not part of the OG type
```ts
interface assignment {
  studentId:string,
  title:string,
  grade:number,
  verified?:boolean
}

function updateAssignment(ass: assignment, propsToUpdate: Partial<Assignment>): assignment {
  return {...ass,...propsToUpdate};//propsToUpdate over writes the props from ass
}

updateAssignment(ass1,{grade:95});
```

2. Required
	makes all the properties Required even the optional ones, like verified in the previous example
```ts
interface assignment {
  studentId:string,
  title:string,
  grade:number,
  verified?:boolean
}
function recordAssignment(ass:Required<assignment>): assignment {
  //save to database or something
  return ass;
}// ass would have to have all of the properties of the assignment interface
```

3. Readonly
makes......... the object readonly tadahhhhhh
```ts
const verifiedAss:Readonly<assignment> = {...ass,verified:true};
verifiedAss.verified=false
//          ~~~~~~~~~ can not assign to verified because it is readonly
```

4. Record
	kinda like object, or a pair in java **Pair<String,String>**
```ts
let a:Record<string,string> = {
  Sara:"A",
  John:"B",
}
```
allows us to use string literals as types too
```ts
type students = "sara" |"john";
type grades = "A"|"B"|"C"|"F";
let a:Record<students,grades> = {
  sara:"A",
  john:"B",
}
```
instead of type we can use interface as well

5. pick and omit, Extract and exclude
	to create types from already existing type by picking and omitting properties
```ts
interface student {
	name:string,
	marks:number,
}

type marks=Pick<student,"marks"|"grade">;
type name=Omit<student,"marks"|"grade">;
```

we cant use pick and omit on interfaces

```ts
type Status = 'done' | 'pending' | 'in-progress';
type WithoutPending = Exclude<Status, 'pending'>; // 'done' | 'in-progress'
type OnlyPending = Extract<Status, 'pending'>; // 'pending'

```

6. NonNullable
```ts
type a="a"|"b"|"c"|null;
type b=NonNullable<a>;
```
