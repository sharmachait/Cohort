We can auto generate the spec file, very easy in type strict languages
we can auto generate clients to interact with API in typescript as well

the spec file is generated from the comments above the endpoint

### generating the client
> npm i openapi-typescript-codegen
> npx openapi-typescript-codegen --input ./spec.json --output ./apiClient

this will generate an apiClient folder with index.ts file with the client implementation
the index.ts exports services (classes) that can be used tohit endpoints
