enums are not a type level addition to the language but something added to the runtime itself
can be achieved with types
```ts
type keyInput="up"|"down"|"left"|"right";

function doSomething(input: keyInput){
//
}
```
better to do with enums
```ts
enum direction {
	up,
	down,
	left,
	right
}
function doSomething(input: direction){
// 
}

doSomething(direction.up); 
```

when we convert it to JS and log **direction.up** we will realize its just a number
enum is not a keyword in javascript
if we dont want the actual value that is used at runtime to be a number, but instead want it to be a string we can create the enum like so
```ts
enum direction{
	up="up",
	down="down"
}
```
all enumerations will have to be a string now
if we want the default values to start from some number other than 0, just specify the first value
```ts
enum direction {
	up=10,
	down,
	left,
	right
}
```
multiple types work as well
```ts
enum d {
  a = 1,
  b = "2",
}
```
a common use case is status codes
