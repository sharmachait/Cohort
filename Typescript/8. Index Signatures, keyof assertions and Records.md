### index signatures
index signatures are usefull when we are creating objects but we dont know exactly the name of the object keys
```ts
type objtype={[key:string]:string};
```
typescript also requires an index signature if we attempt to access properties of object dynamically 
we can iterate an object if its of the type defined using an index signature
instead of key we can also use index
booleans are not allowed as the key
```ts
type objtype={[key:string]:number};

let obj:objtype={hi:1};

for(let o of Object.keys(obj)){
    console.log(obj[o]);
}

for(let key in obj){
    console.log(obj[key]);
}
```
we can create index signatures with interfaces as well
```ts
interface indexSignature {
  [key:string]:number
}
```
an interface / type can have multiple index signatures as long as they are of different types
```ts
interface Example {
    [key: string]: string | number;
    [index: number]: boolean;
}
```
if we make the index signatures readonly they wont allow reassignment to any properties after the object has been created
```ts
type objtype={
    readonly [key:string]:number
};

let obj:objtype={hi:1};

obj['hi']=2;
//~~~~~~~~~~~~ only reading allowed
obj['hi2']=2;
//~~~~~~~~~~~~ only reading allowed
```
the problem with index signatures is that now typescript doesnt know what properties exist so it cant guard against the properties that dont exist on a particular object
and the value is evaluated to be undefined
```ts
type objtype={
    readonly [key:string]:number;
};

let obj:objtype={hi:1};

obj.bye; //ok no error, returns undefined
```
we can have index signatures + other properties types defined in the object interface / type
```ts
interface objtype {
    [key:string]:number;
    Pizza:number;
    Burgir:number;
};

let obj:objtype={hi:1};
//              ~~~~~~  pizza and burgir are required to have
```
but then because of the index signature the value of pizza and burgir can not be anything that violates the index **signature**
```ts
interface objtype {
    [key:string]:number;
    Pizza:number,
    Burgir:string
//  ~~~~~~ Property 'Burgir' of type 'string' is not assignable to 'string' index type 'number'
};
```
also we can have commas semi-colons or even leave the end of each type hanging, all those are allowed
to fix this issue we can use union in the index signature
```ts
interface objtype {
    [key:string]:number | string | string[],
    Pizza:number,
    Burgir:string,
    coke:string[],
};
```
but if some property was undefined we would need to include undefined in the union
```ts
interface objtype {
    [key:string]:number | string | string[] | undefined,
    Pizza:number,
    Burgir:string,
    coke?:string[],
};
```

### keyof assertion
used to iterate over object with no index signatures

```ts 
type obj={
	a:number,
	b:number,
};
let o:obj={a:1,b:2};
for(let key of Object.keys(o)){
	console.log(o[key as keyof typeof o]);
}
```
keyof can be used with the interface or type as well lik eso
```ts
type obj={
    a:number,
    b:number,
};
let o:obj={a:1,b:2};
function logger(o:obj,key: keyof obj):void{
    console.log(o[key]);
}
for(let key of Object.keys(o)){
    logger(o,key as keyof obj);
}
```

### records
instead of using index signatures to make types for objects we can use something know as Records
```ts
type Streams='salary' | 'bonus' | 'sidehustle';
type Incomes=Record<Streams,number>;

let o:Incomes={'salary':3,'bonus':0,'sidehustle':4}
```
useful as string literals are not allowed in key signatures
but we are not allowed to make multiple types of keys in a record, use when we want to create a type with only kind of key
any object of type Income would have to have all three keys 
most useful to replace the index signature syntax in objects
```ts
type oSign={[key:string]:string | number};
type oRec=Record<string,string | number>;

let os:oSign={'hi':'bye','bye':2};
let or:oRec=os;
```
how does looping through records work?
same as objects without index signatures
```ts
type Streams='salary' | 'bonus' | 'sidehustle';
type Incomes=Record<Streams,number>;
  
let o:Incomes={'salary':3,'bonus':0,'sidehustle':4}
  
for(let k of Object.keys(o)){
    console.log(o[k as keyof typeof o]);
}
```
index signatures allow us to bypass the keyof assertion
```ts
type oSign={[key:string]:string | number};
let o:oSign={'hi':2};
for(let k of Object.keys(o)){
    console.log(o[k])
}
```
