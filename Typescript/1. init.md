> npm install -g typescript
> npm init -y
> npx tsc --init

this creates a ts.config file with variables which we can turn on or off which will change our compilation process

##### giving type to a variable
```ts
const x: number =1;
console.log(x);
```
##### transpiling Ts to Js
> tsc -b

# we cant have the same function signature (name and parameters and return types) in two files in the same directory they have to be unique folder wise, why? because of something known as ==ambient modules== , if we export them they will be fine, if we dont they become ambient modules and are confused by the typescript compiler
##### Typescript types
- number
- string
- boolean 
- null
- undefined

##### type definitions for function parameters
```ts
function testing(name: string){
	console.log(name);
}
```

if no type is defined it implicitly takes the any type, and typescript doesnt allow any implicitly, only explicitly

technically the correct way for any function is to include the return type as well
```ts
function testing(a: string): void {
	console.log(name);
}
```

we can define return types with 

```ts
function testing(a: number, b: number): number {
	return a+b;
}
```

even if i dont mention the return type typescript will be able to do basic type inference
###### defining a function that takes another function and runs it after 1 second
in javascript
```js
function runAfter1(callback){
	setTimeout(callback,1000);
}
```
in typescript
```ts
function runAfter1(callback: ()=> void): void{
	setTimeout(callback,1000);
}
```

here the callback function it can accept is a function with no parameters and returns void

#### ts config
1. target option - specifies the ecmascript target version the ts compiler should convert to
2. rootDir/outDir - this option specifies where the compiler should start looking for the ts files, because we dont want the TS files and the auto generated Js files in the same folder use the rootDir option to tell TSC where to look for TS files and the outDir option to where to put the JS files. we can create the SRC and the DIST folder and specify them in the config. (It is generally a good idea to put the dist folder in the gitignore file)
```ts
"rootDir":"./src",
"outDir":"./dist",
```
and then we can run the code with 
> node dist/main.js

3. noImplicitAny - by default is true, doesnt allow implicit any types. can be set to true to allow
4. removeComments:true - removes comments while transpiling

## interfaces

```tsx
interface User{
	name:string;
	email:string;
	age:number;
}
```
###### functions that expect an interface as parameter
```tsx
function isLegal(user: User): boolean{
	if(user.age>=18)return true;
	return false;
}
```
functions like these can be called with
```tsx
isLegal({
	name:"chaitanya",
	age:18,
	email:"chait8126@gmail.com"
})
```

we can have nullable properties in the interface with a ==question mark==
```tsx
isLegal({
	name:"chaitanya",
	age:18,
	email?:"chait8126@gmail.com"
})
```

so in react when we want to create a component with props create an interface for the props
if we try to render the component with a prop that is  not in the interface it will throw an error on compile time
###### implementing interfaces
interfaces can have functions with functions signature as key and return type as value and classes can implement interfaces
```ts
interface Person{
	name: string;
	age: number;
	great(phrase: string): void;
}

class Employee implements Person {
	name: string;
	age: number;
	
	constructor(n: string, a: number){
		this.name=n;
		this.a=a;
	}
	greate(phrase: string){
		console.log(phrase);
	}
}
```

all the properties that are going to be associated to "this" need to be defined in the class like the name and the age

we can also have public and private access specifiers

if we dont want some property to be defined in the constructor using "this" we cna mark it as an optional property in interface and class both
```ts
interface person {
	name?: string;
}
class employee implements person{
	name?:string;
	constructor(){}
}
```

this is the difference between interfaces and types, ==interfaces can be implemented but types can not be implemented==

we can implement multiple interfaces

we can do inheritance via extends keyword

implement an interface and extend a class 

==one interface can extend another interface==
## types
Used to aggregate data together
```ts
type User = {
	name: string;
	age: number;
}
```
#### what else do types provide?

1. Unions - basically "or" but for type definition
```ts
function takesNumberOrString(id: (number|string)){}
takesNumberOrString(1);
takesNumberOrString("1");
```
in type definitions
```ts
type args= number | string;
function fn(arg: args){}
fn(1);
fn("1");
```

2. Intersection - basically "and" but for type definitions
```ts
type employee={}
type manager={}
type teamLead=employee & manager;
```

we can do these intersections and unions with interfaces as well

```ts
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  great?(phrase: string): void;
}
  
type ghatia = {
  hai: boolean;
};
  
type ghatiaadmi = Person & ghatia;
  
type shayadGhatia = Person | ghatia;
  
function isGhatia(admi: ghatiaadmi): void {
  console.log(admi.hai);
}
  
isGhatia({ name: "chaitanya", age: 18, hai: false});
```

what if some property is repeated with different types?
number takes precedence over string so the last line will throw error
```ts
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  great?(phrase: string): void;
};
  
type ghatia = {
  hai: boolean;
  age: string;
};
  
type shayadGhatia = ghatia | Person;
  
function isGhatia(admi: shayadGhatia): void {
  console.log(typeof admi.age);
}
isGhatia({ name: "chaitanya", age: 18 });  
isGhatia({ name: "chaitanya", age: "18" });
```

and if we do intersection between the types / interface to create the new type
the resultant age property will have the type of never and wont be settable
```ts
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  great?(phrase: string): void;
};
  
type ghatia = {
  hai: boolean;
  age: string;
};
  
type ghatiaadmi = Person & ghatia;
  
function isGhatia(admi: ghatiaadmi): void {
  console.log(typeof admi.age);
}
  
isGhatia({ name: "chaitanya", age: "18" });
```
![[Pasted image 20240316145222.png]]
therefor no matter what, we can call this function

when ever we do an intersection or a union the resultant is a type

## Arrays
making an array of a type is as simple as adding [] next to the type

```ts
let arr: number[]=[]; 
type numberArr=number[];
```

### abstract classes
can have code in the functions while other functions can be defined as abstract
