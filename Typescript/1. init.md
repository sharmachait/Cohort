# Initialize A Project
> npm install -g typescript
> 
> npm init -y
> 
> npx tsc --init

install the types for any npm package with
>npm i @types/express
>npm i @types/node

or

> tsc --init

this creates a ts.config file with variables which we can turn on or off which will change our compilation process
# Compile
create a file called main.ts then
> tsc main.ts

or
> tsc main.ts main.js

this creates a ffile called main.js, if we dont provide a js file name it creates the file with the same name as the ts file
to set compiling as a hot reload feature use
> tsc main.ts -w

watches only the  main.ts file

> tsc -w

watches all the files

==when we delete a *.ts file  we need to manually delete the *.js file it was compiled into ==
Alternatively, you could clean the `/dist` folder before each build, which would ensure that it only contains the compiled JavaScript for existing TypeScript files. This can be done by adding a `clean` script in your `package.json` file that deletes the `/dist` folder, which is run before your `build` script.
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "clean": "rimraf ./dist",
    "prebuild": "npm run clean",
    "build": "tsc -b"
  }
}
```

# Ts Config
1. "target" option - specifies the ecmascript target version the ts compiler should convert to
2. "rootDir"/"outDir" - this option specifies where the compiler should start looking for the ts files, because we dont want the TS files and the auto generated Js files in the same folder use the rootDir option to tell TSC where to look for TS files and the outDir option to where to put the JS files. we can create the SRC and the DIST folder and specify them in the config. (It is generally a good idea to put the dist folder in the gitignore file)
```ts
"rootDir":"./src",
"outDir":"./dist",
```
and then we can run the code with 
> node dist/main.js

3. "noImplicitAny" - by default is false, doesnt allow implicit any types. can be set to true to allow
4. "removeComments":true - removes comments while transpiling
5. "include" - to specify which files should be compiled, lets say to compiler only the files in the src folder
6. "exclude" - we can also exclude certain files
```json
{
	"compilerOptions":{
	},
	"include" : ["src"],
	"exclude" : ["**/*.src.spec.ts"]
}
```
7. "noEmitOnError":true - to stop the compiler from compiling in case of a typescript error
8. "strictNullChecks": controls whether variables of other types can be assigned null or not, when off we can set a number type to null, better to keep it on
	1. if you want to allow null go nullable with `let a:(number | null) = null`
# Basic Types for native features
```ts
const x: number =1;
console.log(x);
```
we dont have to initialize variables with types, we can simply declare them and use later on
```ts
let name:string;
name="chaitnaya";
```
##### **Typescript types
- number
- string
- boolean 
- null
- undefined
- literal types
- never type, happens when we make a contradiction while intersecting types 
- never is also the return type for functions that throw errors, or for a function that has an infinite loop inside it

#### literal types
```ts
let name : 'chaitanya';
name='not chaitanya';
//   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ type not assignable to chaitanya
```
## union types | and intersection types &

1. Unions - basically "or" but for type definition
```ts
function takesNumberOrString(id: (number|string)){}
takesNumberOrString(1);
takesNumberOrString("1");
```
in type definitions
```ts
type args= number | string;
function fn(arg: args){}
fn(1);
fn("1");
```

2. Intersection - basically "and" but for type definitions
```ts
type employee={}
type manager={}
type teamLead=employee & manager;
```

## Objects
if we do the following
```js
let obj:object;
```
we can then do the following without typescript complaining
```ts
obj=[];
```

for better constraints choose the following syntax, to define an object with only string keys and number vals
```ts
let obj:{[key:string]:string};
obj={
	'key1':'1',
	"key2":"2"
}
```

if we allow typescript to infer the types, it will fix types to properties
```ts
let obj = {a:1,b"true",c:false};
obj.a=false;
//~~~~~~~~~~~ boolean not assignable to number
```
## Arrays
doesnt allow pushing a number to a string[]
when we declare an array with string[] the length and the order of the element doesnt matter
but if we want to be more specific with our constrictions , where some definite type is locked in at certain indexes, or arrays of definite length we can choose the following syntax AKA tuples
```ts
let myTuple:[string,number,boolean];
```
now myTuple can only be length 3 and only have string at [0] number at [1] and boolean at [2];
if we choose the original syntax our array would have to be declared like so
```ts
let myTupleArray:(string | number | boolean)[];
```
the length of this array is not checked my typescript neither is the order of the elements therefor we cant do the following
```ts
myTuple=myTupleArray;
//~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ type not assignable to other type

myTupleArray=myTuple;//no issues
```

we also cant set the index that is out of bound for the tuple
## Reg ex
```ts
let re:RegExp=/\w+/g;
```

## enums
enums are not a type level addition to the language but something added to the runtime itself
can be achieved with types
```ts
type keyInput="up"|"down"|"left"|"right";

function doSomething(input: keyInput){
//
}
```
better to do with enums
```ts
enum direction {
	up,
	down,
	left,
	right
}
function doSomething(input: direction){
// 
}

doSomething(direction.up); 
```
when we convert it to JS and log **direction.up** we will realize its just a number

enum is not a keyword in javascript

if we dont want the actual value that is used at runtime to be a number, but instead want it to be a string we can create the enum like so
```ts
enum direction{
	up="up",
	down="down"
}
```

if we want the default values to start from some number other than 0, just specify the first value
```ts
enum direction {
	up=10,
	down,
	left,
	right
}
```
==multiple types work as well==
```ts
enum d {
  a = 1,
  b = "2",
  c=3
}
```
a common use case is status codes
