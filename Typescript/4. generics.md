bad way to do generic types
```ts
function fn(arr: (number|string)[] ):void {
	console.log(arr);
}
```
the problem with this approach is 
```ts
 function fn(arr: (number|string)[] ):number|string {
	return arr[0];
}
let a=fn(["a","b"]);
console.log(a.toUpperCase());
```
now we can not use string operations on a because TS doesnt know that we passed in strings
TS would know if we used generics
==another problem with the above approach is that i can call the fn function with an array of number and string, and typescript wont complain because we have used the union of the types==
```ts
let a=fn([1,"hi"]);
```
the better way to fix this second problem would be to define the function like so
```ts
function fn(a: number[] | string[]): number|string {
}
```
but the best way is to use generics
in TS functions can take generics, like classes can take generics in java
```ts
function fn<T>(a: T[]):T {
	return a[0];
}
let a=fn<string>(['a','b']);
a.toUpperCase();
```
now TS would be able to give us string functions as suggestions because it knows for sure the return type is string
