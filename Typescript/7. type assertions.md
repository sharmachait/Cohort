use when we have information about the data that typescript cant possibly know, like the IRL feasibility or for testing 
its telling the typescript compiler that i know more about the type than you do
useful when working with DOM directly
what we can achieve with assertion is to convert to a more specific or a less specific type than we have

```ts
type one=string;
type two=string|number;
type three='string';

let a:one='string';
//converting to a less specific type
let b=a as two;
//converting to a more specific type
let c=a as three;
```

besides the as keyword we can also use the angular brackets syntax <>

```ts
let d=<one>'string';
let e=<two>d;
let f=<three>d;
```

but these cant be used in tsx files

type assertions can be used for narrowing when we know the value of the variable instead of using an if
for instance
```ts
function addOrConcat(a:number|string,b:number|string,c:'add'|'concat'):number|string{
    if(c==='add'){
        let aa=a as number;
        let bb=b as number;
        return aa + bb;
    };
    return ''+a+b;
}
  
let concatted:string=addOrConcat('hi','son','concat') as string;
let added:number = addOrConcat(1,2,'add') as number;
console.log(concatted.toUpperCase());
console.log(Math.sqrt(added));
```
but we need to be careful because
```ts
let added:number = addOrConcat(1,2,'concat') as number;
```
typescript wont complain about this but a string is returned
so when i do Math.sqrt on it it will throw an error

that given typescript can still check types where it can despite assertions
```ts
10 as string
// ~~~~~~~~~ type number conversion to string may be a mistake
```
typescript wont allow this
but it still tells us how this is possible its tells us to convert the number to unknown first then to string
unknown is like any but we cant use it anywhere except for type conversions
this type of conversion is called as ==forced casting or double casting==
```ts
(10 as unknown) as string
```

## DOM
assertions are very useful when working with the DOM
```ts
const img=document.getElementById('img') as HTMLImageElement;
//or
const img=document.getElementById('img')!;
```

! is known as non null assertion to be used when we know its not null
