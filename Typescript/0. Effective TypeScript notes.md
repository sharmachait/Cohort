so long as your JavaScript program doesn’t have any syntax errors then it is also a TypeScript program. It’s quite likely that TypeScript’s type checker will flag some issues with your code. But this is an independent problem. TypeScript will still parse your code and emit JavaScript.

### type narrowing
if a value is nullable but we want to access some property of it opt for one of the following syntaxes
```ts
function returnNllOrString(): (null|string){
    return "null";
}
let x:string | null=returnNllOrString();
  
x!.toLowerCase()
  
x?.toUpperCase()
  
if(x){
    x.toUpperCase()
}
```

the exclamation mark is called a non null assertion

## You Cannot Check TypeScript Types at Runtime
```ts
interface Square {
  width: number;
}
interface Rectangle extends Square {
  height: number;
}
type Shape = Square | Rectangle;

function calculateArea(shape: Shape) {
  if (shape instanceof Rectangle) {
    //                 ~~~~~~~~~ 'Rectangle' only refers to a type,
    //                           but is being used as a value here
    return shape.height * shape.width;
    //           ~~~~~~ Property 'height' does not exist on type 'Shape'
  } else {
    return shape.width * shape.width;
  }
}
```
the way to achieve this would be
```ts
function calculateArea(shape: Shape) {
  if ('height' in shape) {
    return shape.width * shape.height;
    //     ^? (parameter) shape: Rectangle
  } else {
    return shape.width * shape.width;
  }
}
```
another way to do so is
```ts
class Square {
  width: number;
  constructor(width: number) {
    this.width = width;
  }
}
class Rectangle extends Square {
  height: number;
  constructor(width: number, height: number) {
    super(width);
    this.height = height;
  }
}
type Shape = Square | Rectangle;

function calculateArea(shape: Shape) {
  if (shape instanceof Rectangle) {
    return shape.width * shape.height;
    //     ^? (parameter) shape: Rectangle
  } else {
    return shape.width * shape.width;
    //     ^? (parameter) shape: Square
  }
}
```

we can also do unions on classes and define that as a type alias
