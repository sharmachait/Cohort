so long as your JavaScript program doesn’t have any syntax errors then it is also a TypeScript program. It’s quite likely that TypeScript’s type checker will flag some issues with your code. But this is an independent problem. TypeScript will still parse your code and emit JavaScript.

### type narrowing
if a value is nullable but we want to access some property of it opt for one of the following syntaxes
```ts
function returnNllOrString(): (null|string){
    return "null";
}
let x:string | null=returnNllOrString();
  
x!.toLowerCase()
  
x?.toUpperCase()
  
if(x){
    x.toUpperCase()
}
```

the exclamation mark is called a non null assertion

## You Cannot Check TypeScript Types at Runtime
```ts
interface Square {
  width: number;
}
interface Rectangle extends Square {
  height: number;
}
type Shape = Square | Rectangle;

function calculateArea(shape: Shape) {
  if (shape instanceof Rectangle) {
    //                 ~~~~~~~~~ 'Rectangle' only refers to a type,
    //                           but is being used as a value here
    return shape.height * shape.width;
    //           ~~~~~~ Property 'height' does not exist on type 'Shape'
  } else {
    return shape.width * shape.width;
  }
}
```
the way to achieve this would be
```ts
function calculateArea(shape: Shape) {
  if ('height' in shape) {
    return shape.width * shape.height;
    //     ^? (parameter) shape: Rectangle
  } else {
    return shape.width * shape.width;
  }
}
```
another way to do so is
```ts
class Square {
  width: number;
  constructor(width: number) {
    this.width = width;
  }
}
class Rectangle extends Square {
  height: number;
  constructor(width: number, height: number) {
    super(width);
    this.height = height;
  }
}
type Shape = Square | Rectangle;

function calculateArea(shape: Shape) {
  if (shape instanceof Rectangle) {
    return shape.width * shape.height;
    //     ^? (parameter) shape: Rectangle
  } else {
    return shape.width * shape.width;
    //     ^? (parameter) shape: Square
  }
}
```

we can also do unions on classes and define that as a type alias

## structural compatibility
```ts
interface Vector2D {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

interface NamedVector {
  name: string;
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

function calculateLength(v: Vector2D) {
  return Math.sqrt(v.x ** 2 + v.y ** 2);
}

const v: NamedVector = { x: 3, y: 4, name: 'Pythagoras' };
calculateLength(v);  // OK, result is 5
```

we didnt have to change the declaration/ implementation of the calculate function because the interface NamedVector is structurally compatible to the Vector2D interface
but this can lead to issue as well
consider having a 3D vector interface and we write a function on it to normalize it, that is, divide each value by its length

```ts
interface Vector3D {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  z: number;
}

function normalize(v: Vector3D) {
  const length = calculateLength(v);
  return {
    x: v.x / length,
    y: v.y / length,
    z: v.z / length,
  };
}
```

typescript will allow this but this will give us the wrong answer, because the calculate length function doesnt take the 3rd dimension into account
if we want this to be something that type script checks for us we can turn on the strict config option 
the strict option turns on other options :-

1. `noImplicitAny`: Raises an error on expressions and declarations with an inferred type of `any`.
2. `noImplicitThis`: Raises an error on `this` expressions with an inferred type of `any`.
3. `alwaysStrict`: Parse in strict mode and emit `"use strict"` for each source file.
4. `strictBindCallApply`: Enable stricter checking of the `bind`, `call`, and `apply` methods on functions.
5. `strictNullChecks`: In strict null checking mode, the `null` and `undefined` values are not in the domain of every type and are only assignable to themselves and `any`.
6. `strictFunctionTypes`: Enable stricter checking of function types.
7. `strictPropertyInitialization`: Ensure non-undefined class properties are initialized in the constructor.

it’s easy to imagine that functions will be called with arguments having the properties you’ve declared _and no others_. 
This is known as a “closed,” “sealed,” or “precise” type, and ==*it cannot be expressed in TypeScript’s type system*==
```ts
type aa={a:number}

function printA(obj:aa):void{
  for(let key of Object.keys(obj)){
    console.log(obj[key]);
    //          ~~~~~~~~~ key has any type cant be used for indexing
  }
}
```

The type of `k` is `string`, but you’re trying to index into an object whose type only has three specific keys: `'a'` There are strings other than these three, so this has to fail.

The logic in the previous code  assumes that `obj` is sealed and does not have other properties. But it could:
```ts
type aa={a:number}

function printA(obj:aa):void{
    console.log(obj.a);
}

type bb={a:number,b:number}

let b:bb={a:2,b:4}
printA(b) //ok no complain
```
