#### querying data
1. checking equality
```jsx
find({name:{$eq:"sally"}});
//same as
find({name:"sally"});
//or
find({}).where(name).equals("sally")
```
2. checking not equals
```jsx
find({name:{$ne:"sally"}})
```
3. greater than /equals to and less than /equals too
```jsx
find({age:{$gte:13}})
//$gt $lte $lt
```
4. to check a fields in a list of values, we can also do not in
```jsx
find({name:{$in :["kyle","sally"]}})
//$nin
```
5. multiple aggregations
```jsx
find({age:{$gte:20,$lte:40}})
```
by default it does an and over the queries
we can specify with
```jsx
find({$and:[{age:{$gte:26}},{name:'kyle'}]})
```
we need to specify if we wanna do or with $or
```jsx
find({$and:[{age:{$gte:26}},{name:'kyle'}]})
```
we also have to $not query to negate what ever the inner query is
```jsx
find({ age: { $not: { $lte:20 } } })
```
this would also return where the ages are null, had we used $gt we would not have gotten those nulls
we can write complex expressions to compare more than one field of our document
let say to return all the users with debt > balance
```jsx
find({ $expr: { $gt: ['$debt','$balance'] } })
```
==as you can see if we need to specify a column we need to use the dollar sign in front of the column name==

what if our field is nested? 
User.address.street is a valid field

```jsx
find({ "address.street":"123 main st" })
```

#### updating data
updating requires $ operators
```jsx
UserModel.updateOne({ age:26 }, { $set: { age:27 }})
```
to set we need to use $set

to increment some number property by some value like 3 we can do this
```jsx
UserModel.updateOne({ age: { $lte:0 } }, { $inc: { age:3 } })
```

we can rename column/fields with $rename
```jsx
UserModel.updateOne({ age: { $lte:3 } }, { $rename: { name:"toddler" } })
```

to remove a field from a document we can unset the field with empty values 
```jsx
UserModel.updateOne({ age: { $lte:3 } }, { $unset: { name:"" } })
```
this will remove the name field of all the documents where age is less than equal to 3

to add to arrays we can $push a value into it
```jsx
UserModel.updateOne({ _id:ObjectId('...')}, { $push:{ hobbies:"swimming" } })
```
here hobbies must be a list

we can remove properties from list fields with $pull
```jsx
UserModel.updateOne({ _id:ObjectId('...')}, { $pull:{ hobbies:"swimming" } })
```

we can also do updateMany to target multiple documents
