###### UNIONS
to combine the result of two or more select statements refer the sql server notes write the same queries in the postgresql
## rolling window pattern sql
```sql
select
    c2.visited_on,
    sum(c1.amount) as amount,
    round(sum(c1.amount)/7.0,2) as average_amount
from
    Customer as c1
inner join (
    select distinct visited_on
    from Customer
    order by visited_on asc
    offset 6
    ) as c2
on
    c1.visited_on >= c2.visited_on-6
    and c1.visited_on <= c2.visited_on
group by
    c2.visited_on
order by
    c2.visited_on
```
## views
basically a cached select statement in the database that can be used as a table
```postgresql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW purchase_order_overview AS 
SELECT 
		sales_order.purchase_order_number, 
		customer.company,
		sales_item.quantity,
		product.supplier,
		product.name,
		item.price,
		(sales_item.quantity * item.price) AS Total,
		CONCAT(sales_person.first_name,' ',sales_person.last_name) AS Salesperson,
		sales_item.id as sales_item_id
FROM 
	sales_order
JOIN
	sales_item
ON
	sales_item.sales_order_id = sales_order.id
JOIN
	item
ON 
	item.id = sales_item.item_id
JOIN 
	customer
ON 
	sales_order.cust_id = customer.id
JOIN
	product
ON
	product.id = item.product_id
JOIN
	sales_person
ON 
	sales_person.id = sales_order.sales_person_id
ORDER BY purchase_order_number;


select * from purchase_order_overview
where purchase_order_number = 20166617;

update sales_item set quantity = 987698789 where id=164;

select * from purchase_order_overview
where purchase_order_number = 20166617;
``` 
the values of the view update dynamically
even the total column and the name column are updated
we can drop views with 
```postgresql
DROP VIEW <NAME OF THE VIEW>
```
**but if we want to update the data in the tables via the views** 
**the views must not contain**
- **group by**
- **having**
- **limit**
- **offset fetch**
- **distinct**
- **with**
- **union**
- **intersect**
- **except**
## transactions

```postgreSQL
BEGIN; --start transaction

INSERT INTO users (username,email,password)
VALUES ('john_doe','some@email.com','somepassword');

INSERT INTO addresses (user_id,city,country,street,pincode)
VALUES (currval('user_id_seq'),'dehradun','india','kaulagarh road','249001');

COMMIT;
```
the `ROLLBACK` caluse is used to signal the end of the block and revert changes
When you start a transaction, any changes you make to the data aren’t visible to other database users until you execute COMMIT
