not as simple as multiple folders in one folders
multiple projects in the same folder that share code, how they are built how the shared code must be hosted somewhere need to be done incase not monorepo
### benefits of monorepos
1. shared code reuse
2. enhanced collaboration
3. optimized Builds and CI/CD, with tools like turbo repos
4. Centralized Tooling and Configuration

### MonoRepo frameworks
1. lerna
2. Turborepo not exactly a framework
turbo repo either sets up NX or Yarn workspaces under the hood which are turbo repo frameworks
### Build System VS Build System Orchestrator vs Monorepo framework
##### build systems include transpilation, bundling and minification
##### Monorepo Framework provides tools for managing projects that contain multiple projects, including dependency management and workspace configuration
##### Turbo repo is a build system orchestrator, it allows us to define tasks in our monorepo for transpilation, bundling, minification or tests, via other tools like tsc or vite

Turbo repo takes care of things like building the common modules before the modules or projects that depend on that common module.
it orchestrate the build process
as it understand the dependency graph it can also help us parallelize the build process
it can also cache the build process so its faster

### init
> npx create-turbo@latest

this creates 5 modules
1. apps/web - next.js webstie
2. apps/docs - docs website for all the documentation of the project
3. packages/ui - ui packages
4. packages/typescript-config - shared TS config
5. packages/eslint-config - shared ESLint config

> npm i
> npx next telemetry disable
> npm run dev

the packages/ui module will have the name `@repo/ui` in the package.json
which is a path alias for this module???????

also in the package.json we have the exports section to specify what all files are allowed to be exported

we can import from this module if it has name `@repo/ui` and an export at path `"./button":"./src/button.tsx"` like so
```tsx
import {button} from '@repo/ui/button'
```
so the name of the module along with the exports defined in the package.json together form the path alias for components
also in the projects using these components being exported from `@repo/ui` we must include `@repo/ui` as a dependency in the package.json of that project like so
![[Pasted image 20240615151114.png]]
we might need to add the packages/ui folder manually into the tailwind config like 
`../../packages/ui/**/**.tsx`

turbo repo also provides us with remote caching so if the code hasn't changed in a commit it simply uses the artifact saved in some blob storage

### generators
its pretty tedious to add all the components in the package.json for each ui component that we create
![[Pasted image 20240616133712.png]]
to solve this exact problem turbo repo provides us with generators
the `generate:component` script in the above image is used to add the components in the turbo folder to the package.json and create the react component out of the generator code

the command` npm run generate:component `has to be ran in the UI folder
it asks for the name of the component we want to create, it creates the component that we can customize to our liking

### turbo.json
configuration for the turbo repo
![[Pasted image 20240616170220.png]]
in this context he build pipeline is used when we do npm run dev in the root folder the `^build` means that turborepo needs to build all the individual modules
the outputs property defines the binary directory and the location of the cache of the build and because next also caches we have to specify to not look into the next.js caches

### adding a react project to the turbo repo
> cd app
> npm create vite@latest
> cd ..
> npm i

doing a global `npm i` goes into all the package.json files and installs for all the projects

thats all we dont have to register the new react app anywhere because its package.json has the dev script so turbo is able to run it as well

we can simply start using the common react components in the package folder in the react application and we can also import it using path aliasing
we dont need to define a dependency in the package.json of the react application
why?
because the components are already part of the global node_modules
but this doesnt mean we should not add the dependency in the react app
we should add it like this
![[Pasted image 20240616174103.png]]
the tsconfig created for react by vite should also extend the react tsconfig
we can specify the port we want to run the react app in the package.json dev script like so
![[Pasted image 20240616223525.png]]
### adding an express backend project to the monorepo
> npm init socketServer

this initializes an empty package.json
what should the name for this project, like @repo/ui for the ui project
as long as the project is not being used by anyother project we dont need to think about what the name should be

next step is to initialize typescript in it
> npx tsc --init

this creates the tsconfig.json for the projetc
but isnt the typescript config shared between he projects? in the packages folder?
a base.json for tsconfig already exists in the packages folder

if we go to other projects tsconfigs they extend the tsconfigs from the packages folder
![[Pasted image 20240616192309.png]]
like so

so we should clean out the tsconfig the `npx tsc --init` created for me and extend the tsconfig from the base config in the packages folder
```json
{
	"extends":"@repo/typescript-config/base.json",
}
```
all the properties can be over ridden by specifying them in this json
an example of a good config for a node.js project can be found at
[turbo/examples/kitchen-sink/apps/api/tsconfig.json at main Â· vercel/turbo (github.com)](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/blob/main/examples/kitchen-sink/apps/api/tsconfig.json)

we also need to add the build and the dev script for the express app
for express
```json
{
	"scripts":{
		"build":"tsc -b",
		"dev":"tsc -b && npm run dist/index.js",
	}
}
```
after adding these to the package.json of the express project we can run npm run build or npm run dev at the root level of the project, and that would run all the projects with these scripts defined
### adding a common package 
for the express application to import from
for stuff like types, models, zod schemas etc

create a folder called common in the packages folder and `npm i` it up
`npx tsc --init` it up and extend the base config something like 
![[Pasted image 20240616230555.png]]
change the name of the common project to something like `"@repo/common"`
we also need to specify everything this common project will export in the package.json like so
![[Pasted image 20240616230725.png]]
we dont need this package compiled ever we just need to import from it
so we dont need a build script in these shared modules

if we want to import form it we will need to add its dependency in all the projects that use it with
```json
{
	"dependencies":{
		"@repo/common":"*"
	}
}
```

whenever we add a new project we need to `npm i` in the root folder so that everything is brought into the global node_modules

we wont be able to import from the common project in the backend project that simply
a simple solution for that is to not use the tsc compiler
use esbuild or tsup
