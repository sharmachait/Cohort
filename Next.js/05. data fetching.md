in next we fetch the data on the server side and pre render the page before returning it to the user
we can still do api calls for external apis
using useEffects will require us to make the component a client side component

#### server side data fetching and loaders
done using async components
```tsx
import axios from 'axios';  

const Page = async () => {  
	const res = await axios.get(  
		'https://week-13-offline.kirattechnologies.workers.dev/api/v1/user/details'  
	);  
	const data = res.data;  
	return (
		<div>
			{data.name}
		</div>
	);  
};  

export default Page;
```

notice the component function itself in asynchronous

the server side request may take a long time, and the client will have nothing to show in the meantime
add a spinner, **without hooks**
use a file called loading.tsx at the same level as the page.tsx server component
```tsx
const loading = () => {  
  return <div>loading...</div>;  
};  
export default loading;
```
![[Pasted image 20240611074417.png]]
we can see the effects clearly by adding an awaited time out int he function fetching our data
```tsx
await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 5000));
```
like so
```tsx
import axios from 'axios';  
const Page = async () => {  
  const res = await axios.get(  
    'https://week-13-offline.kirattechnologies.workers.dev/api/v1/user/details'  
  );  
  await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 5000));  
  const data = res.data;  
  return <div>{data.name}</div>;  
};  
export default Page;
```


###### do we really need an api call to fetch data in a server side component? it is server side so we dont need it we can simply have the logic to read data from database in the server side component it self.
