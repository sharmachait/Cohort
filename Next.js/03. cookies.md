must necessarily use cookies, can do only tokens
cookies are used for authentication
also for cross site tracking
to track sessions stores personal information for personalized ads
tracking users

we cant use local storage in next.js
why?
because the first request that is sent by the browser can not be authorized. it wont have the required headers
because of server side rendering
as the data needs to be personalized from the very first request itself and it needs to be rendered on the server side. the browser must tell the server which user is logged in but that can not be done with the first request.

but with cookies if the browser has the a cookie for a web site it will be sent for each and every request to the server
cookies have inbuilt expiry system
cookies can be restricted https and certain domain

### kinds of cookies
1. persistent - auth cookies
2. session -  only stay for a session as soon as we close the tab they go away

Secure cookies -  can only be sent over encrypted https connections, benefit of cookie over tokens

### cookie properties
1. HttpOnly - can not be accessed by client side scripts
	1. client script wont be able to do `cookie.get('token')`
2. SameSite - ensures cookies are not sent on cross origin requests
	1. says that a particular cookie is not for randomWebsite.com but only for the predefined frontend domains which are white listed at the server level
	2. strict
	3. lax - allows only get requests
	4. none
3. domains can be specified to be served
	1. not good enough because we may use lax and that would still allow get requests
why are these properties use full? to protect against CSRF attacks

### CSRF attacks
cross site request forgery, by forging using the caught cookie
solved using the SameSite attribute

SameSite : none is bad causes CSRF attacks
SameSite : strict also has issues even though it prevents CSRF attacks
why is it bad? lets say i have a business that i promote on different platforms like instagram and youtube and i have links on those platforms that link back to my website. so if someone is logged in, and they click a link that takes them to my website, because the request generate form a third party like instagram, strict mode wont allow cookie to be sent to the backend in that case. basically a request goes to the frontend but my frontend is server side rendered, and since the request generated on a third party website cookie wont be sent to the server
this third party website is set as the referrer of the request in the request\
this is what lax fixes, this is called top level navigation and lax allows cookies to be sent like that

barebones express in typescript app using cookies (for syntax purposes)
```ts
import express from "express";
import cookieParser from "cookie-parser";
import cors from "cors";
import jwt, { JwtPayload } from "jsonwebtoken";

const app = express();
app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(express.json());
app.use(cors({
    credentials: true,
    origin: "http://localhost:5173"
}));

app.post("/signin", (req, res) => {
    const email = req.body.email;
    const password = req.body.password;
    // do db validations, fetch id of user from db
    const token = jwt.sign({
        id: 1
    }, JWT_SECRET);
    res.cookie("token", token);
    res.send("Logged in!");
});

app.get("/user", (req, res) => {
    const token = req.cookies.token;
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET) as JwtPayload;
    // Get email of the user from the database
    res.send({
        userId: decoded.id
    })
});


app.post("/logout", (req, res) => {
    res.cookie("token", "ads");
    //or
    res.clearCookie('token');
    res.json({
        message: "Logged out!"
    })
});

app.listen(3000);
```


for multiple cross origins

```ts
app.use(cors({ credentials: true, origin: ["http://localhost:5173", "http://example.com", "http://localhost:5174"] }));
```

```ts
const allowedOrigins = [ 'https://example1.com', 'https://example2.com' ]; const corsOptions = { 
	origin: (origin, callback) => { 
		if (allowedOrigins.includes(origin) || !origin) { 
			callback(null, true); 
		} else { 
			callback(new Error('Not allowed by CORS')); 
		} 
	}, 
	credentials: true, 
}; 
app.use(cors(corsOptions));
```

doing an axios call with `withCredentials:true` is only required if the frontend and backend are hosted on different domains
