immature in next.js will change over time
commonly used for authentication ,analytics and redirection

nextjs requries us to have a single file called middleware.ts that exports all the middlewares

the funciotsn exported from the root level middleware.ts will be called before all the requests, backend and frontend

@/middleware.ts
```ts
import {NextRequest,NextResponse} from 'next/server';

let reqCount=0;
export function middleware(req:NextRequest){
	reqCount++;
	
	const res=NextResponse.next();
	
	return res;
}
```

all this is simpler, but this middleware is for all the damn routes
what if we want to restrict our middleware over some routes?

we can add a regex matcher for the routes and export it from the same file

```ts
export config={
	matcher:'api/:path*'
}
```
now the middleware will run only for the backend routes

but his is not very fine grained filtering

easiest way to do it is to extract the url from the request object and write custom filtering logic
```ts
import {NextRequest,NextResponse} from 'next/server';

let reqCount=0;
export function middleware(req:NextRequest){
	if(req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/admin')){
		return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/signin',request.url));
	}
	else{
		reqCount++;
		const res=NextResponse.next();
		res.cookies.set('theme','dark');
		res.headers.set('custom-header','custom-value')
		return res;
	}
}
```
we can also fuck around with the cookies to give user tailored experience
we can also add custom headers for fuck knows what
