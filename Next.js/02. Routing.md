## routing
everything in the app folder is routed
### shared layouts
![[Pasted image 20240610111327.png]]
##### shared layouts without the `auth` being in the route
if we want a folder to not be part of the route use `(auth)`
![[Pasted image 20240610111606.png]]
now we can go to `app/signin` and all the routes under `(auth)` will have the same layout because 

to make the app router completely ignore a folder for routing name it with a preceding underscore
### dynamic routes
use the folder name like `[paramName]`
the paths to the page.tsx should look like 

`app/product/[id]/page.tsx`

now the page.tsx will be rendered for any value at `[id]`

we can access the value of the id param in the page.tsx at that level like so

```tsx
type paramsType = {params:{id:string}};
export function ProductDetails({params}:paramsType){
	return (
		<h1>
			{params.id}
		</h1>
	);
}
```
#### nested dynamic routes
for stuff like `domain/products/1/reviews/1`

in the page.tsx at the `products/[productId]/review/[reviewId]` we can access both the parameters

```tsx
type paramsType={
	params:{
		productId:stirng,
		reviewId:stirng
	}
}
export default function ReviewDetails({params}:paramsType){
	return (
		<h1>
			<h2>
				{params.productId}
			</h2>
			<h2>
				{params.reviewId}
			</h2>
		</h1>
	);
}
```

### Catch All Segments
when we have too much nesting but all the pages will share the same layout we would still need to create all the folders in the nested path, that is, without catch all segments

if we know our routes well enough and know that they are going to be standard we can create catch all segments for the routes, to handle all the routes in one file
create folder path like this
`docs/[...pages]/page.tsx`
this page.tsx will be rendered for anything and everything with `docs` in the route

in the catch all segment page.tsx we can access all the segments of the url like so
```tsx
type CatchAllType={
	params:{
		slug:string[]
	}
}
export default function CatchAll(params:CatchAllType){
	if(params.params.slug.length==2){
		return (
			<h1>
				viewing docs for feature {params.params.slug[0]} component {params.params.slug[1]}
			</h1>
		);
	}
	else if(params.params.slug.length==1){
		return (
			<h1>
				viewing docs for feature {params.params.slug[0]}
			</h1>
		);
	}
	else{
		return (
			<h1>
				Home Page
			</h1>
		);
	}
}
```

now if we go to localhost:3000/docs/feature/component
or
to localhost:3000/docs/feature
or
to localhost:3000/docs

these cases are handled by our page.tsx

### search params
for routes like /auth/verify?token=jhagfjhsdg

to get the token from the route use the hook useSearchParams

## dynamic routes
in a folder named like so `[...param]`

## navigation
### Link
we can use the Link component to navigate to some route, this will create an anchor tag that can be clicked
```tsx
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function home(){
	return <Link href="/some/place/else">someplace else</Link>
}
```

to back in the route like from `some/place/else`to `some/place`
`<Link href="some/place"></Link>`
#### what about dynamic routes?
just use a dynamic f string with the variable `some/place/at/${here}`
#### removing back history
just use the replace attribute of the Link tag
```tsx
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function home(){
	return <Link href="/some/place/else" replace>someplace else</Link>
}
```
hitting back now will take us to the home page
### styling active links different from the other ones
to get the current active link Next.js provides us a hook called usePathname
it can only be used in client components
```tsx
'use client'

import Link from 'next/link';
import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation';

const navLinks = [
  { name: 'register', href: '/register' },
  { name: 'login', href: '/login' }
];

const StyleLinks = ({ link, pathname }) => {
  const isActive = pathname.startsWith(link.href);

  return (
    <Link href={link.href} key={link.name}
      className={isActive ? "font-bold mr-4" : "text-blue-500 mr-4"}
    >
      {link.name}
    </Link>
  );
}

export default function Page({ children }) {
  const pathname = usePathname();

  return (
    <div>
      {navLinks.map(link => (
        <StyleLinks key={link.name} link={link} pathname={pathname} />
      ))}
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}

```

### navigating programmatically
next.js provides another client side hook to do so called the useRouter hook from next/navigation
```tsx
'useClient'
import {useRouter} from 'next/navigation';
export default function page(){
	const router=useRouter();
	const navigateButton=()=>{
		console.log("navigating");
		router.push('/');
	}
	return (
		<>
			<button onClick={navigateButton}>navigate</button>
		</>
	)
}
```
if we want to replace the navigation history instead of the `push('/')` function use the `replace('/')` function
to go back one page programmatically use the `router.back()` function
use the `router.forward()` function to go one page forward

## route groups
grouping routes and files without affecting the URL segments
keep the files in `(folderName)`
another usecase of a route group can be to apply a layout to certain pages

## catching search params
```tsx
import {useSearchParams} from 'next/navigation';
```
## parallel routes
allows simultaneous rendering of multiple pages within the same layout
![[Pasted image 20240704224513.png]]
solution one
create components for each and define their layout in the layout.tsx like so![[Pasted image 20240704224559.png]]this can also be achieved via parallel routes
parallel routes are defined using something knows as slots which are just annotations
to define a slot use the `@folder` annotation
each slot is then passed as a prop to its corresponding layout.tsx
![[Pasted image 20240704224939.png]]
the functions being exported from these pages will be passed to the layout just like children
we can receive these functions in the layout and render them to our liking
![[Pasted image 20240704225711.png]]

benfeit? each slot can have their own loading.tsx and error.tsx in the slot folder for fine grained error control and UX
to achieve stuff like
![[Pasted image 20240704230039.png]]

also allows us to do sub-navigation for individual slots
![[Pasted image 20240704230524.png]]
when one of the component changes we can reflect that in the route as well to do that
```tsx
import Link from 'next/link'
export default function Notifications(){
	return (
		<div>
			<Link href='/complex-dashboard/archived'>Archived</Link>
		</div>
	);
}
```
this route will take us to the component in the `@notifications/archived/page.tsx`
while the default view will be served from `@notifications/page.tsx`
![[Pasted image 20240704230901.png]]
from this page.tsx export another component which will replace the page.tsx in the @notifications slot

```tsx
import Link from 'next/link'
export default function ArchivedNotifications(){
	return (
		<div>
			Archived notifications
			<Link href='/complex-dashboard'>Archived</Link>
		</div>
	);
}
```

but when we are at the archived route only the notifications slot has the matching route

the other two slots have unmatched routes
next js handles unmatched slots 
- in case of navigation in the UI next.js retains the previously active state of the slot regardless of the changes in the URL
- incase of a page reload next.js searches for a default.tsx file for each unmatched slot
- if the default.tsx file is missing next.js will render a 404 error
- therefor we should define a default.tsx file for each slot, main children slot as well
- in the default.tsx we are free to render whatever we want

## conditional routes
parallel routes allow us to do conditional routing
based on authentication status we can either show the dashboard slot or the login form slot
this enables fully separated code on the same URL
![[Pasted image 20240705110100.png]]
where login is like children and received as a slot in the params
