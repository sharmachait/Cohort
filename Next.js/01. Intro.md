# Why Next
problems with react
1. at least 2 projects one for frontend and one for backend
2. no built in routing mechanism
3. not SEO optimized
	1. why? because the initial html is empty and is filled up as the user interacts with it, so the dummy bot crawlers are not able to rank SPA, hence not SEO optimized
	2. the content in SPA is dependent on the JS but the crawlers google uses, do not run the JS. they only look at the html
	3. solved because of server side rendering
4. waterfalling problem
	1. the request cycle takes a bunch of steps, even for a simple blob website

	2. all these requests dont happen parallelly
	3. this is known as the waterfalling problem
	4. solved due to server side rendering
## features
1. server side rendering (ssr)
2. API routes - full stack framework
3. file based routing
4. bundle size optimisation
5. static site generation (ssg)
## downsides
1. cant be distributed via a CDN, always needs a server running that does the server side rendering, therefore is expensive (for static sites ofcourse)
2. hard to migrate out of

# init
> npx create-next-app@latest

in it choose typescript, eslint, tailwind, and app router
## page metadata
the name of the tab and description can be exported from every page by exporting an object of type Metadata
```tsx
import type {Metadata} from 'next';

export const metadata:Metadata={
	title:"Page Name",
	description:"some description for the page for SEO optimization"
}
```
## file structure
folders inside the app folder will serve as the route and the page.tsx file at the folder level will be served
## server side response
when we go to a route we get the whole ass html for that route in the network tab
## dynamic routes
in a folder named like so `[...param]`
## layout.tsx file
used to wrap child pages in some logic
the layout file must default import a function like the other page files
the function must expect `children:React.ReactNode`, this refers to the component being exported from the page.tsx at the same level
it must return `Readonly<{children:React.ReactNode}>`
basically wrap the child it received in some other html and logic and return wrapper jsx for the children

we can have layout.tsx at the same level as the page.jsx
describes the layout for all the subfolders from that level

can be used for stuff like nav bars
## server components
in next all components are server components by default.
they have the ability to read files or fetch data from database on the server
cant use hooks or handle user interactions
## client components
necessary to add the use client on top of the component file
can use hooks and manage interactions
## routing
