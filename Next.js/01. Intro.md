# Why Next
problems with react
1. at least 2 projects one for frontend and one for backend
2. no built in routing mechanism
3. not SEO optimized
	1. why? because the initial html is empty and is filled up as the user interacts with it, so the dummy bot crawlers are not able to rank SPA, hence not SEO optimized
	2. the content in SPA is dependent on the JS but the crawlers google uses, do not run the JS. they only look at the html
	3. solved because of server side rendering
4. waterfalling problem
	1. the request cycle takes a bunch of steps, even for a simple blob website
![[Pasted image 20240609172413.png]]
	2. all these requests dont happen parallelly
	3. this is known as the waterfalling problem
	4. solved due to server side rendering
## features
1. server side rendering (ssr)
2. API routes - full stack framework
3. file based routing
4. bundle size optimisation
5. static site generation (ssg)
## downsides
1. cant be distributed via a CDN, always needs a server running that does the server side rendering, therefore is expensive (for static sites ofcourse)
2. hard to migrate out of

# intro
## init
> npx create-next-app@latest

> npm run dev
> npm run build
> npm run start


in it choose typescript, eslint, tailwind, and app router
## page metadata
the name of the tab and description can be exported from every layout page by exporting an object of type Metadata
```tsx
import type {Metadata} from 'next';

export const metadata:Metadata={
	title:"Page Name",
	description:"some description for the page for SEO optimization"
}
```
## file structure
folders inside the app folder will serve as the route and the page.tsx file at the folder level will be served
## server side response
when we go to a route we get the whole ass html for that route in the network tab
## layout.tsx file
used to wrap child pages in some logic
the layout file must default import a function like the other page files
the function must expect `Readonly<{children:React.ReactNode}>`, this refers to the component being exported from the page.tsx at the same level
basically wrap the child it received in some other html and logic and return wrapper jsx for the children
we can have layout.tsx at the same level as the page.jsx
describes the layout for all the subfolders from that level
can be used for stuff like nav bars
## loading.tsx
showed to the users until data loads for the page.tsx.
page.tsx must be asynchronous
suspense for page.tsx when we await something directly in the page.tsx
## not-found
we can have a custom not found page by creating a file called `not-found.tsx` inside the app directory. We must follow this naming convention for it to work. The not found file must export default a function called NotFound()
but at times we may need to display this page programmatically, to do that we Next.js provides us the notFound function, simply call it in your code when some condition is satisfied
we can have multiple not-found.tsx files at different levels and it will be served accordingly at different urls
## file colocation
we can have flexibility in our file and folder structure and still get our app router to work as we want
a path is not publicly accessible until it has a page.tsx file in it, there fore we can have other files in a folder as well without them being served
## private folders
are not considered by the router
to make a folder a private folder simply prefix its name with an underscore
if we want to use an underscore in the URL segments we can prefix the folder name with ‘%5f’, which is the URL encoded form of an underscore
## metadata
nextjs provides a metadata api for SEO
ways to configure metadata
1. export statis metadata object
2. export a dynamic generateMetadata function
#### metadata rules
1. both the layout and page can export metadata
	1. if defined in the layout it applies to all the pages under that layout
2. metadata is read in order from the root level to the final page level
3. when metadata across multiple places they get combined but page metadata takes precedence over layout metadata if both have the same properties
for dynamic metadata
```tsx
import {Metadata} from 'next';
type Props = {
	params:{
		productId:string;
	}
}
export const generateMetadata = ({params}:Props):Metadata=>{
	return {
		title:'Product ${params.productId}'
	}
}

export default function Page({params}:Props){
	return (<h1>hi</h1>);
}
```
the generateMetdata function can also be asynchronous

## server components
in next all components are server components by default.
they have the ability to read files or fetch data from database on the server
cant use hooks or handle user interactions
## client components
necessary to add the use client on top of the component file
can use hooks and manage interactions
### **we cant have on click handlers in the server side components and by default everything is server side in next.js**

if you want interactivity in a page put the `use client` directive on top of the file

server side components can not be children of client side components
## components folder
we dont want every tsx file to be routed
like simple button or navbar components for that use the components folder to make files for them, they wont be routed by next.js
we can actually name the folder anything just make sure to include that folder in the tailwind config

## templates - template.tsx
layouts dont re-render the jsx that is shared among the children of the layout.
90% of the time that is exactly the thing we need but sometimes we might need for the parent jsx to be re-rendered as well.
use templates in such cases.
cases like running a useEffect when the route changes to a sub route of the layout
we can use template instead of the layout file

basically the same as layout but is re-rendered even when we switch between the children routes
state is not preserved and effects are ran

## error handling error.tsx
a normal error page is not seen in production mode when we npm run build and npm run start
we get something like
![[Pasted image 20240625002009.png]]
to handle the errors gracefully
create a file called error.tsx at the same level as the page.tsx
this wraps around our page.tsx like an error boundary
error.tsx must be client component
error.tsx 
```tsx
'use client'
export function ErrorBoundry({error}:{error:Error}){
	return <div>{error.message}</div>
}
```

this will replace our component that threw the error

automatically wraps the route segment component in an error boundary
isolate errors to affected segments from the whole ass app
allow addition of error recovery functionality without having to reload the whole page
for example the refresh table page in a Jira board
### Recovering from errors
some errors are not serious and can be handled by simply refreshing.

the error boundary function also receives a reset function parameter
we can provide a button in the error boundary that calls this function on clicking and that would refresh the component
```tsx
'use client'
export function ErrorBoundry({
	error,
	reset
	}:{
	error:Error,
	reset:()=>void
}){
	return (
		<div>
			{error.message} 
			<button onClick={reset}>Try again</button>
		</div>
	);
}
```
but for this to work our page.tsx must be client side as well

errors from a page trickle up to the nearest error boundary
### ==component hierarchy of all the special files==
![[Pasted image 20240625002935.png]]
### handling errors in layouts
as you can see in the hierarchy above the layout is above  the error boundary so it doesnt catches the errors in the layout file if they are at the same folder level
to catch an error in the layout we will have to move the error.tsx to the parent of the layout
