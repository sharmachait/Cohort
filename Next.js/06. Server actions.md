if we want to ever hit an endpoint from the server, but we also need to hit it from some front end

basically do something that an endpoint does in some server side component, then we can create server actions which are functions we can call both at the frontend and at the backend

the bad way to do it is to do an http request from the backend to the backend
or we can abstract the logic out into server actions

if we have a server action we can completely get rid of the http endpoint

the client will send an http request only but the server action isnt exposed as an http endpoint, kinda like a grpc call

we can import the signup server action into the component and then call it from the frontend which will sort of send an http request from the frontend to the backend
but we wont have to write an axios.get or axios.post in the frontend

create another folder in the app folder called actions
create user.ts to write all the user actions
actions will just be functions and the way the actions receive inputs changes
the inputs change simply to function parameters
**we also need to specify "user server" on top for it to be a server action**
when writing react components server is default
we have to specify "use server" on server actions so that the client components dont feel that the function being made is to a client side function but a server action instead
and then instead of the axios.post we can simply do a function call to the server action with the parameters 
```ts
'user server';  
export async function signup(username: string, password: string) {  
  try {  
    //do bhang bhosda on server  
    return true;  
  } catch (e) {  
    return false;  
  }  
}
```

```tsx
"use client"
import {useState} from 'react';
import {signup} from '..app/actions/user'
export function Signup(){
	const [email,setEmail]=useState('');
	const [pass,setPass]=useState('');
	const handleSignup=async (e)=>{
		e.preventDefault();
		const response=await signup(email,pass);
		console.log(response);
	}
	return (
		 <SignupForm 
			setEmail={setEmail} 
			setPass={setPass} 
			email={email} 
			pass={pass}
			onClick={handleSignup}
		/>
	);
}
```
this logs true on the frontend console
but we wont see anything in the browser network tab because browser doesnt know how to parse the format that server actions use
we can also use this server action at the server level in a server component and that wont be a http call, that will just be a simple function call

another benefit of server actions is that when we do a server action from a client side component then the response is of known type but in case of an http call the response is of type any
