- bidirectional web server to browser communication
- capable of sending and receiving data simultaneously over TCP
- web sockets keep a unique connection open
- full duplex asynchronous messaging
- allows client and server to stream messages to each other independently
- originally created for client to server communication
- can be used for client to client

- when the server agrees to the handshake it send a 101 status code indicating switching protocol and the TCP/IP connection is left open

> npm install ws

server side setup
```js
const websocket = require('ws');
const server = new websocket.Server({port:'8080'});

server.on('connection',socket=>{
	socket.on('message',msg=>{
		socket.send('got it');
	});
});
```

client side setup
```js
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');
socket.onmessage = ({data})=>{
	console.log(data);
}

const handleClick(e)=>{
	e.preventDefault();
	Socket.send('hello');
}
```

thats pretty much all that can be achieved with the ws library, it can not broadcast message to multiple clients, for features like group chat use socket.io instead
- websockets use the ws (websocket) or the wss(web socket secure) protocols
to be able to user websocket server along with rest APIs we need to use HTTP server instead of express which looks like so
```js
import express from 'express';
import http from 'http';
import {WebSocketServer} from 'ws';

const app=express();
const port =3000;
const server=http.createServer(app);

const socketServer = new WebSocketServer(server);
```
now the socket server can be used instead of the express server like we would, and we can create the rest end points with app

orrrrrrr
```js
const app = express();
const server = app.listen(  
  process.env.PORT,  
  console.log(`listening on ${process.env.PORT}`)  
);
const socketServer=new ws.WebSocketServer({ expressServer });
server.on('connection', (socket) => {  
  console.log('connected');  
});
```



`socket.emit` allows you to emit custom events on the server and client

`socket.send` sends messages which are received with the `'message'` event

`socket.send(data, callback)` is essentially equivalent to calling `socket.emit('message', JSON.stringify(data), callback)`
