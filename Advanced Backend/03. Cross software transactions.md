to maintain ACID across multiple softwares not just a single DB but across multiple different DBs or Queue providers
use the transactional out box pattern
instead of a single process creating an entry and pushing onto kafka
like so

enter into two different tables in the DB one for the Data that was supposed to go to the DB and one for the data that supposed to go to kafka but hasnt gone onto kafka yet and do this in a transaction
have another process that reads the second table and pushes onto kafka, and if it successfully pushes to kafka we can remove from DB or put a flag like pushed true
like so
