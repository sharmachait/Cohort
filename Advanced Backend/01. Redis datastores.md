## how redis persists data
even if redis instance goes down we can still regenerate the data that it had 

redis allows us to do that by keeping track of all the transactions/migration that took place in a queue and replay all of them first in first out fashion to recreate the state of the data store before the instance went down, this is achieved via AOF (Append Only file),
AOF persistence logs every write operation received by the server, appending each operation to the file.

the problem? what if the queue becomes very long

solution? snapshot the datastore every one hour

with the combination of snapshots and the AOF we can safely reconstruct the data efficiently

snapshots are achieved via RDB files (redis database files), which perform point in time snapshots of the data at specified intervals. 
we can specify redis to do something like snapshot every X minutes if Y keys have changed with
```
save 900 1
```
### data structures in redis
1. strings
2. lists
3. sets
4. hashes
5. sorted set
6. bitmap
7. json
8. geospatial
9. redis streams, can be used instead of kafka
	1. stream commands
		1. XADD add new entry to the stream
			1. returns a time stamp and number of entries at the same time stamp
		2. XREAD to read one or more entries
		3. XRANGE for a range of entries
		4. XLEN for the length of the stream
	2. streams are an append only log so adding are o(1), accessing single entry is o(n)
## if there is a write operation to the database, how should we get the cache in sync with the data? 
![[Pasted image 20240703232822.png]]

==**answer is <1> why? how would we manage transactions in multiple softwares, what if write to postgres succeeded but write to redis failed? would you roll back from postgres? not optimal**==

## redis as message broker
> docker run --name my-redis -d -p 6379:6379 redis
> docker exec -it container-sha /bin/bash
> redis-cli

this will get us into redis cli on a container

to set values into the redis instance
> set user "chaitanya"

to get some value
> get user

to delete some value
> del user

to check if a key exists
> exists user

we can use regex to find keys with
> keys *

we can delete everything in the datastore with
>flushall

we can set time to live for a key, by default for all keys its set to -1 that is infinite
we can check time to live for a key with
> ttl name

we can set expiration time for a key for 10 seconds with
> expire name 10

when a key is deleted the ttl for it is set to -2

to set a key and the expiration at the same time 
> setex name 100 kyle


# hashes to store json objecs
## sets
> sadd hobbies "weight lifting"

to see the members of the set
> smembers hobbies

to remove something from the set
> srem hobbies "weight lifting"
## maps
adding to a map
```
hset person name kyle
hset <map> <key> <value>
```
to get everything form a map
> hgetall person

to get just a particular property from the map
> hget person name
> hget map key

to delete a key from the map
>hdel person age

to see if the map contains a key
>hexists person age

to assign complex objects to a map
>hset user:100 name "chaitanya" email "chait8126@gmail.com"
>hget user:100 name
>hget user:100 email

we can extend the existing object in the cache to have more keys
> hset user:100 name "chaitanya" email "chait8126@gmail.com"
> hset user:100 address "some address"

# lists
### implementing a queue
##### pushing to a queue
```
LPUSH problems 1
LPUSH problems 1
```

##### popping from a queue
```
RPOP problems
RPOP problems
```

##### getting multiple elements from the list
```
lrange problems 0 -1
```
-1 to get all the item in the list

##### blocking pop
when my queue is empty i want to wait till there is more data to pop the result of the command,
using blocking pop will block the thread until something pops out of the queue
done via 
> BRPOP problems 0

the zero tells redis to wait infinitely for a push

## interaction with redis using node.js
> npm i redis

```tsx
import express, { Request, Response } from 'express';
import { createClient } from 'redis';
  
const client = createClient();
//const client = createClient({url:""});
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.post('/submit', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  try {
    const { problemId, userId, code, language } = req.body;
    await client.lPush(
      'submissions',
      JSON.stringify({ problemId, userId, code, language })
    );
    res.json('submissions received');
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e);
  }
});
async function startServer() {
  try {
    await client.connect();
    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('connected to redis');
    });
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e);
  }
}
startServer();
```

by default this tries to connect to the local host

the listener can be as simple as

to do a blocking pop just use brPop instead
