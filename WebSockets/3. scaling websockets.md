### Resiliency of WebSockets

store the moves and games in the database the socket server should not be stateful (state of the game/application should not be stored on the server)

but our server can not be entirely stateless because then to check if the move is valid we would have to bring all the moves from the database in to the memory

so we need an in memory object and state to be stored in the database, and someway to rehydrate the in memory object from the database

but storing to databases is slow, can cause latency. to solve that we can use in memory cache like redis, and we can store the moves into the database in bulk from redis to the database

### scaling web sockets

if we have 150000 users active and 1 server can handle 10000 active users, have 15 servers, the first 10000 users go to the first server next 10000 to the next server

thing to take care of - if two people are in the same room, they need to be connected to the same server, will have to shard the servers carefully

but this cant support people in the same room on different servers, for like 1 million people wanting to watch the same game

to handle this we need a bunch of servers with 10k users per server, because we need to relay events from one server to another we need some sort of pub sub model here (kafka) the server hosting the players will be the publisher and the servers with spectators will be the subscribers
