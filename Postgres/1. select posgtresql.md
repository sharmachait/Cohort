###### Operators to be used with the where clause
- **Equal**: `=`
- **Less than**: `<`
- **Greater than**: `>`
- **Less than or Equal**: `<=`
- **Greater than or Equal**: `>=`
- **Not Equal**: `<>` or `!=`
###### logical operators 
- **AND**
- **OR**
- **NOT**
## Distinct
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT <column_name> FROM <table_name>;
```
the distinct keyword is distinct over all the values being selected not just one
this helps us write queries for questions like for each district who are all the candidates up for election
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT district, candidate FROM election_registrations;
```
this will return the distinct pair of district and candidates
## ordering
ordering by multiple columns
```sql
SELECT lastname, firstname FROM teachers ORDER BY lastname ASC, firstname DESC;
```
## limiting
limiting the number of rows in the output
```postgresql
SELECT * FROM sales_item 
WHERE discount > .15
ORDER BY discount DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
top 3rd salary
```postgresql
SELECT salary FROM employee
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2;
```
top 3rd salary in case of duplicates
```postgresql
SELECT DISTINCT salary 
FROM employee
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2;
```
## string manipulation functions
```postgresql
SELECT CONCAT(first_name,' ',last_name) AS name
FROM sales_person;
```
## date manipulation functions
```postgresql
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date) from customer;
```
## group by and aggregation functions
sum, count, avg etc round() min(), max()
```postgresql
SELECT product_id,SUM(price) 
FROM item 
WHERE product_id = 1 
GROUP BY product_id ;
```
***the WHERE clause must be before group by clause***
for queries like how many people have had birth days in each month
```postgresql
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date) AS Month, COUNT(id) 
FROM sales_person 
GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date)
HAVING EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date) <> 12;
```
***the HAVING clause is used after the group by***
***the ORDER BY clause can be after the group by***
we need the HAVING clause because we cant use aggregation functions in the where clause because it is applied before grouping
there fore the following queries may be equivalent
```postgresql
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date) AS Month, COUNT(id) 
FROM sales_person 
GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date)
HAVING EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date) <> 12;


SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date) AS Month, COUNT(id) 
FROM sales_person 
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date) <> 12
GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date);
```
but thats because the filtering criterion does not use any aggregation over the groups
we would typically only use having when we want to filter on the basis of some aggregated criterion

## UNIONS
to combine the result of two or more select statements refer the sql server notes write the same queries in the postgresql
## logical cases
```postgresql
select 
	something,
	case 
		when 
			t.x<5 
		then 'No'
		else
			'yes'
	end as columnName
from triangle as t
```
## aggregate functions
we can use aggregate functions without grouping by as well
1. count()
2. sum()
3. round(val,2)
4. avg()
5. min()
6. max()
## views
basically a cached select statement in the database that can be used as a table
```postgresql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW purchase_order_overview AS 
SELECT 
		sales_order.purchase_order_number, 
		customer.company,
		sales_item.quantity,
		product.supplier,
		product.name,
		item.price,
		(sales_item.quantity * item.price) AS Total,
		CONCAT(sales_person.first_name,' ',sales_person.last_name) AS Salesperson,
		sales_item.id as sales_item_id
FROM 
	sales_order
JOIN
	sales_item
ON
	sales_item.sales_order_id = sales_order.id
JOIN
	item
ON 
	item.id = sales_item.item_id
JOIN 
	customer
ON 
	sales_order.cust_id = customer.id
JOIN
	product
ON
	product.id = item.product_id
JOIN
	sales_person
ON 
	sales_person.id = sales_order.sales_person_id
ORDER BY purchase_order_number;


select * from purchase_order_overview
where purchase_order_number = 20166617;

update sales_item set quantity = 987698789 where id=164;

select * from purchase_order_overview
where purchase_order_number = 20166617;
``` 
the values of the view update dynamically
even the total column and the name column are updated
we can drop views with 
```postgresql
DROP VIEW <NAME OF THE VIEW>
```
**but if we want to update the data in the tables via the views** 
**the views must not contain**
- **group by**
- **having**
- **limit**
- **offset fetch**
- **distinct**
- **with**
- **union**
- **intersect**
- **except**
