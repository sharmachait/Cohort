###### Operators to be used with the where clause
- **Equal**: `=`
- **Less than**: `<`
- **Greater than**: `>`
- **Less than or Equal**: `<=`
- **Greater than or Equal**: `>=`
- **Not Equal**: `<>` or `!=`
###### logical operators 
- **AND**
- **OR**
- **NOT**
### Distinct
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT <column_name> FROM <table_name>;
```
the distinct keyword is distinct over all the values being selected not just one
this helps us write queries for questions like for each district who are all the candidates up for election
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT district, candidate FROM election_registrations;
```
this will return the distinct pair of district and candidates
### ordering
ordering by multiple columns
```sql
SELECT lastname, firstname FROM teachers ORDER BY lastname ASC, firstname DESC;
```
### limiting
limiting the number of rows in the output
```postgresql
SELECT * FROM sales_item 
WHERE discount > .15
ORDER BY discount DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
top 3rd salary
```postgresql
SELECT salary FROM employee
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2;
```
top 3rd salary in case of duplicates
```postgresql
SELECT DISTINCT salary 
FROM employee
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2;
```
### string manipulation functions
```postgresql
SELECT CONCAT(first_name,' ',last_name) AS name
FROM sales_person;
```
### date manipulation functions
```postgresql
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date) from customer;
```
### group by and aggregation functions
sum, count, avg etc round() min(), max()
```postgresql
SELECT product_id,SUM(price) 
FROM item 
WHERE product_id = 1 
GROUP BY product_id ;
```
***the WHERE clause must be before group by clause***
for queries like how many people have had birth days in each month
```postgresql
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date) AS Month, COUNT(id) 
FROM sales_person 
GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date)
HAVING EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date) <> 12;
```
***the HAVING clause is used after the group by***
***the ORDER BY clause can be after the group by***
we need the HAVING clause because we cant use aggregation functions in the where clause because it is applied before grouping
there fore the following queries may be equivalent
```postgresql
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date) AS Month, COUNT(id) 
FROM sales_person 
GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date)
HAVING EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date) <> 12;


SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date) AS Month, COUNT(id) 
FROM sales_person 
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date) <> 12
GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date);
```
but thats because the filtering criterion does not use any aggregation over the groups
we would typically only use having when we want to filter on the basis of some aggregated criterion
